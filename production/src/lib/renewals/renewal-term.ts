/**
 * How much a renewal quote is for, and for how long.
 *
 * ─── THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `createOrGetRenewalQuote` computed the amount as:
 *
 *     const annualAmount = Math.round((input.mrr ?? 0) * 12);
 *
 * Hardcoded twelve, and `term_months` appears nowhere in that file. On 22 Aug 2026 a
 * term-aware reminder LADDER shipped — the cron references `term_months` in four
 * places — but the work stopped at the reminders and never reached the quote. So a
 * MONTHLY subscription gets quoted for a YEAR.
 *
 * Measured 23 Aug 2026 on the row that renews first (c398e832, "Xyz cloud solutions",
 * 10 seats of Business Starter, `term_months = 1`, renewal 27 Aug, `auto_renew = true`):
 *
 *     correct one month   10 x 270          = ₹2,700 ex-GST   → ₹3,186 incl
 *     what it would quote 32,400 x 12       = ₹3,88,800 ex    → ₹4,58,784 incl
 *
 * about **144x** the right figure, four days out, on a subscription set to renew
 * automatically.
 *
 * That factor is two defects compounding, and both are handled here:
 *
 *   1. **The term is assumed.** A 1-month subscription must be quoted for 1 month.
 *   2. **`mrr` on that row holds an ANNUAL figure.** Every other subscription stores a
 *      genuine per-month rate — SAHAKAR is 14 seats at ₹3,780, exactly ₹270/seat/month,
 *      matching the catalogue. That one row stores ₹3,240/seat, which is ₹270 x 12. A
 *      per-seat rate more than about twice the catalogue price cannot be a monthly rate,
 *      and `suspectAnnualMrr` says so rather than quietly multiplying it again.
 *
 * ─── AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES ─────────────────────────────────────
 * When the stored rate looks like an annual figure this does NOT silently divide by 12
 * to "repair" it. Dividing would produce a plausible number from data known to be
 * untrustworthy, and a plausible wrong price on a customer-facing quote is the worst
 * outcome available. The caller is told to stop and have a human look.
