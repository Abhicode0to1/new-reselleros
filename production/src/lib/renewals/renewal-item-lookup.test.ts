/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The renewal's catalogue lookup must key on item_id, not on the plan NAME.

   Found 24 Aug 2026, while about to rename two catalogue items. `create-renewal-quote.ts`
   matched `items.name = input.plan`, and `plan` is a TEXT COPY taken when the subscription
   was created — so the two drift the moment anybody renames a product. The rename was
   exactly that: the catalogue said "Google Workspace Standard" while customers write
   Google's real name, "Google Workspace Business Standard".

   A missed lookup here is not cosmetic. `catalogPerSeatMonth` is what `renewalTerm` checks
   the stored `mrr` against, and that check is the only thing that caught a 144× renewal on a
   live subscription. Renaming an item would have blinded the guard for every subscription
   sold under the old name — silently, until its renewal date, which for the live row is
   24 Aug 2027.

   Pinned on the SOURCE because the failure is a missing join key: a mock would need the
   whole supabase builder to prove which column was filtered on, and the thing to protect is
   the column choice itself.
