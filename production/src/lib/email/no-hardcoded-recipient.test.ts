   No server route may hardcode WHO an email goes to.

   Found 22 Aug 2026 by reading api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts while chasing an
   unrelated log line. Five routes carried a module-level literal:

       const PARDEEP_EMAIL = "Pardeep@exceltechnologies.in";

   and used it as `to:` / `replyTo:`. The razorpay route had already been fixed to
   resolve the tenant's own address, and its header explains the cost:

     "in a multi-tenant product every tenant's payment alert, carrying their
      customer's name, email and amount, was mailed to one fixed address. The
      owner of the tenant that made the sale never got it, and someone else did."

   The other four kept the bug. api/cron/trial-expiry SELECTS `tenant_id` for every
   expired trial, never reads it, and mails all of them — company, contact name,
   contact email, phone, domain — to that single inbox. Three public buy-page
   routes also put it in `replyTo:` on the CUSTOMER's mail, so customers were told
   to reply to a domain the company no longer uses.

   ─── WHY THIS TEST IS BRAND-AGNOSTIC ─────────────────────────────────────────
   The obvious guard is `expect(src).not.toMatch(/exceltechnologies/)`, which is
   what lib/whatsapp.test.ts does for message signatures. Wrong tool here: tenant
   3bbd2280 legitimately HAS that address on file, and a brand-dated guard passes
   happily the day somebody hardcodes `pardeep@anutech.in` instead — the identical
   bug with a fresher domain. So this checks the SHAPE (a literal recipient) and
   not the string, and it will fail on a hardcoded address nobody has thought of
   yet.

   Recipients only — `from:` is deliberately not checked. A From default like
   `onboarding@resend.dev` is a sender identity the provider requires, not a
   decision about whose desk a tenant's customer data lands on.
