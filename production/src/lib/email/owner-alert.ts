/**
 * Who gets the "money landed / lead landed / trial ended" alert for a tenant.
 *
 * ─── THE BUG THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Five server routes carried this, module-level:
 *
 *     const PARDEEP_EMAIL = "Pardeep@exceltechnologies.in";
 *
 * and used it as the `to:` of the owner alert — in four of them unconditionally,
 * ignoring the tenant entirely. `api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts` had already been
 * fixed to resolve the tenant's own address and its header says why:
 *
 *   "in a multi-tenant product every tenant's payment alert, carrying their
 *    customer's name, email and amount, was mailed to one fixed address. The
 *    owner of the tenant that made the sale never got it, and someone else did."
 *
 * The other four were missed. `api/cron/trial-expiry/route.ts` is the clearest:
 * it SELECTS `tenant_id` for every expired trial, never filters or reads it, and
 * mails all of them — company, contact name, contact email, phone, domain — to
 * that one address.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS NOT A "STALE BRAND" FIX ────────────────────────────────────
 * The tempting fix is to ban `exceltechnologies.in`, since CLAUDE.md §1 records
 * that brand as historical. That would be wrong twice over. Tenant
 * `3bbd2280-b8e3-4e70-98c9-6916d85708fb` genuinely has `pardeep@exceltechnologies.in`
 * as its recorded contact, so banning the domain would block that tenant's own
 * mail — its address is the operator's data, not this module's business. And a
 * ban list dated to one brand goes stale the moment somebody hardcodes
 * `pardeep@anutech.in` instead, which is the identical bug wearing a fresher
 * domain.
 *
 * The defect is the HARDCODED LITERAL, not the domain in it. So there is no
 * default here and no constant to fall back to: the address comes from the
 * tenant row or it does not come at all.
 *
 * ─── AND A MISSING ADDRESS IS REPORTED, NEVER SUBSTITUTED ───────────────────
 * Same posture as `lib/invoices/supplier-identity.ts`: an unknown identity is
 * reported, never guessed. A tenant with no email on file produces a named
 * reason the caller must log — not a send to somebody else's inbox, which is how
 * this bug stayed invisible (the alert always "worked", it just arrived at the
 * wrong desk). Callers must treat `ok: false` as loud: the underlying event is
 * already recorded in the database, so losing a NOTIFICATION while saying so is
 * strictly better than delivering a tenant's customer data to a third party.
