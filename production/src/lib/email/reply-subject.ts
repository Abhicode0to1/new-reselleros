/**
 * The subject a REPLY must carry, so the customer's mail client keeps it in one conversation.
 *
 * ─── THE MAIL THAT ASKED FOR THIS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * 31 Aug 2026. A real enquiry arrived with the whole request in the subject line:
 *
 *     "mujhe 32 email id ke liye quote chahiye google business starter"
 *
 * The app handled it well — lead created, product matched, quote Q-ADPL-2026-27-0055 drafted
 * at 32 seats, correctly NOT sent because the mail never said monthly or annual. It answered
 * within 13 seconds, and `email_log` recorded `provider gmail · status sent`.
 *
 * Pardeep never saw it. The agent had invented its own subject —
 *
 *     "Re: Google Workspace Business Starter quotation - Sri Ganga Technologies"
 *
 * — so Gmail did not group it with the thread he was looking at. The reply was sitting in his
 * inbox as a separate conversation. From where he sat, the app had simply not answered.
 *
 * A reply that lands outside its own thread is, for the person waiting, indistinguishable from
 * no reply at all. The model may write the body; it does not get to name the conversation.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Gmail threads on `In-Reply-To` / `References` first and falls back to subject-and-
 * participants. `lib/email/send.ts` cannot set custom headers today (neither the Resend nor
 * the Gmail transport takes any), so this relies on the fallback. It is the cheap half of the
 * fix and the half that shows on screen; real header threading is a separate change to both
 * transports.
