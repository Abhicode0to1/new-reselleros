/**
 * Laying out a waterfall — the geometry, separated from the drawing.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS A PURE FUNCTION AND NOT JUST JSX ───────────────────────────
 * A waterfall's whole meaning is in where each bar STARTS. Get the running total wrong
 * and the chart still renders beautifully, with bars floating at plausible heights, and
 * nobody can tell by looking. That is a bug you can only catch with arithmetic, so the
 * arithmetic lives here with tests and the component only draws what it is handed.
 *
 * ─── AND WHY NOT RECHARTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Recharts is already a dependency and has no waterfall. The usual workaround is a
 * stacked BarChart with an invisible base series — which means the "cost" bar is really
 * two bars, one of them a lie told to the layout engine, and the tooltip then has to be
 * taught to hide it. An inline SVG is fewer moving parts and exact.
 *
 * ─── SIGNS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `delta` is signed: revenue is positive, COGS and expenses are negative. Totals
 * (`isTotal`) do not move the running balance — they RESTATE it, which is what makes
 * Gross Margin and Net Profit render as full columns from the axis rather than as
 * floating steps.

 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE THE WATERFALL ───────────────────────────────────
 * A waterfall on a thin-margin business has a scale problem no styling fixes: ANUTECH's
 * ₹67,000 net profit against ₹9,14,376 of revenue is 7% — a bar four pixels tall next to
 * one that fills the plot. The chart is accurate and the most important number on it is
 * the one you cannot see.
 *
 * Normalising to ₹100 removes the scale entirely. "Of every ₹100 you invoice, ₹63 goes to
 * Google, ₹30 to running the business, ₹7 is yours" is a sentence a reseller can hold in
 * their head and repeat to their accountant. Lakhs are not.
 *
 * ─── THE SHARES ARE FORCED TO SUM TO 100 ────────────────────────────────────
 * Rounding three percentages independently gives 63 + 30 + 7 = 99 or 101, and a bar
 * captioned "of every ₹100" that adds to 101 is the kind of small wrongness that makes a
 * reader distrust the whole page. Profit absorbs the remainder because it is the
 * derived figure — the other two are measured.
