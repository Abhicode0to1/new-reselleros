/**
 * MRR waterfall — Starting → New → Expansion → Contraction → Churn → Ending.
 *
 * ─── READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE NUMBERS ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The textbook waterfall is a LEDGER: every time a subscription's MRR changes you
 * write a row saying what it went from, what it went to, and why. This database
 * does not have that ledger. `subscriptions` holds one current `mrr` per row and
 * nothing about its history — `activity_log` (0222) records THAT a subscription
 * changed, never what it changed from.
 *
 * So this module does the only honest thing available: it reconstructs what it
 * genuinely can, and refuses to invent the rest.
 *
 *   COMPUTABLE from created/cancelled dates alone:
 *     New   — subscriptions that started inside the window
 *     Churn — subscriptions that ended inside the window
 *
 *   NOT COMPUTABLE without a ledger:
 *     Expansion   — an existing customer paying more (upgrade, seats added)
 *     Contraction — an existing customer paying less (downgrade, seats removed)
 *
 * Reporting Expansion as ₹0 would read as "nobody upgraded this month". The truth
 * is "we did not record it". Those are completely different facts to run a
 * business on, so `expansion` and `contraction` are `null`, and the UI renders
 * them as `—`, not as zero.
 *
 * ─── THE RESIDUAL IS THE POINT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because expansion and contraction are missing, the identity
 *
 *     Starting + New − Churn  =  Ending
 *
 * will NOT hold whenever anybody changed a plan or a seat count. Rather than hide
 * that, `unexplained` carries the gap: Ending − (Starting + New − Churn). It is
 * the net of the expansion and contraction we failed to record, and its SIZE tells
 * the owner how blind this report currently is. A large residual is not a bug in
 * the arithmetic — it is the missing ledger, showing itself.
 *
 * One more caveat that cannot be engineered away here: `startingMrr` is built from
 * subscriptions that existed at the window's start using their CURRENT mrr, since
 * no other value exists. If a subscription was upgraded mid-window, that increase
 * is silently absorbed into Starting instead of appearing as Expansion. That makes
 * the residual an UNDER-estimate of true movement. `basis` reports which mode
 * produced the figures so a caller never has to guess.
 *
 * When migration 0236 (mrr_movements) is applied and has accumulated history,
 * `fromLedger()` computes all five components exactly and the residual goes to
 * zero. Both paths are tested.
