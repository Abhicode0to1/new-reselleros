/**
 * The P&L model — and the reason it exists is a number the old page got wrong.
 *
 * ─── THE PAGE WAS REPORTING A 100% GROSS MARGIN ─────────────────────────────
 * /accounting/pnl reads COGS from `vendor_bills where category like 'COGS-%'`. That table
 * has **zero rows** on the live tenant. So the report showed:
 *
 *     Revenue      ₹x
 *   − COGS         ₹0
 *   = Gross Margin 100%
 *
 * A reseller does not have a 100% margin. They buy licences and sell them.
 *
 * And the cost is NOT missing from the app — only from that table. The subscriptions
 * carry it: 9 Google subscriptions, 199 seats, ₹1,08,552/month of MRR against ₹70,340 of
 * wholesale. That is a 35.2% margin, which is a healthy reseller number and the one the
 * owner needed to see. The P&L was reading the empty table instead of the full one.
 *
 * ─── SO COGS HAS A BASIS, AND THE BASIS IS ALWAYS ON SCREEN ─────────────────
 * `billed`    — real vendor bills exist. Accrual, auditable, what a CA wants.
 * `estimated` — no bills, so cost is derived from subscription × wholesale rate.
 * `unknown`   — neither is available, and the margin is NOT reported.
 *
 * The two are never silently mixed and an estimate never renders as a fact. An estimate
 * is far better than a zero — zero produces a confident wrong answer, and "unknown"
 * produces no answer at all — but it is somebody's rate card, not their invoice, and the
 * screen has to say which one it is.
 *
 * ─── A ZERO COST MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ─────────────────────────────────
 * Taken from lib/subscriptions/margin.ts, which already got this right. Against Google,
 * Microsoft or Zoho, a zero cost is data nobody filled in. Against the reseller's OWN
 * support product it is genuinely free of vendor cost — ANUTECH's 4 support subscriptions
 * really do carry ₹0 wholesale.
 *
 * Treating the first as 100% margin puts the healthiest number in the app on the row we
 * know least about, which is exactly backwards.
 *
 * ─── WHOLE RUPEES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything in and out is integer rupees. The only division is the margin percentage,
 * which is presentation, never stored.

  /* ── THE ESTIMATE IS A RATIO, NOT A RUPEE TOTAL ─────────────────────────────
     This was wrong on the first pass and the live data showed it immediately.

     Invoiced revenue and subscription cost accrue on completely different clocks. ANUTECH
     invoiced ₹9,14,376 on 17 August — annual terms, billed in one day — while the
     subscription book accrued about ₹35,283 of licence cost over that half-month. Putting
     those two in the same waterfall gave a 96% margin: a whole year of revenue against a
     fortnight of cost.

     So when there are no vendor bills, the book supplies the RATIO (cost ÷ revenue,
     62.5% here) and it is applied to the revenue actually recognised. The rupees then sit
     on the same clock and the margin matches the per-vendor figures below it — 37%, not
     96%, and not the 100% this page shipped with.

     The assumption is stated on screen: it holds while what you invoiced resembles what
     you sell. A reseller who suddenly bills a large one-off consulting job would see it
     costed like a licence, which is why the fix is a vendor bill, not a better guess. */
