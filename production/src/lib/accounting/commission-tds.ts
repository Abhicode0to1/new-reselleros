/**
 * Commission to one person, and when s.194H TDS applies.
 *
 * s.194H: TDS on commission / brokerage once the amount credited to ONE payee in a financial
 * year exceeds ₹20,000 (from FY 2025-26; it was ₹15,000), at 2% (from 1 Oct 2024; it was 5%).
 * Once the year's total crosses the limit, TDS is due on the whole year's commission to that
 * person — so a ₹20,000 payment after ₹5,000 earlier crosses it, and the earlier ₹5,000 is
 * caught too. The screen suggests; the operator (and their CA) decides.
