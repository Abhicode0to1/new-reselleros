/**
 * Say an amount the way an Indian owner reads it — "50 lakh", "5.9 lakh", "1.2 crore" —
 * under the box it is typed into.
 *
 * ₹50,00,000 and ₹5,00,000 differ by one zero and look almost the same in a form; "50 lakh"
 * and "5 lakh" do not. A ₹50L contract was booked as ₹5L (26 Sep 2026) because nothing on
 * screen said the number back in words. And a number wildly off its reference (the lead's
 * budget, the bank receipt) is flagged before it is saved — once invoiced it can only be
 * corrected with a credit / debit note.
