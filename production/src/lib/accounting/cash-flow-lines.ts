/* ── Cash flow statement, direct method (27 Sep 2026) ────────────────────────
   The three activities a CA wants the month's cash sorted into. Classified from how
   the line was reconciled, never from its narration:
     operating — the business itself: customer receipts, vendor bills, expenses, salaries,
                 statutory, advances to vendors
     investing — buying assets: an expense in the Equipment category (the fixed asset
                 register takes it from there)
     financing — money in/out of the owner and lenders: lines marked reconciled by hand are
                 the capital / director-loan / loan bookings (book_bank_credit, loans), so
                 they sit here and the label says so
   Transfers between own accounts cancel and are left out; unreconciled lines are shown
   apart, because a statement that quietly guesses them is not a statement. */
