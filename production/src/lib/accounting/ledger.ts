/**
 * The khata — a running Debit/Credit statement for one customer or one vendor.
 *
 * ─── THE TWO LEDGERS ARE MIRROR IMAGES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE BUG SURFACE ───
 * A customer is a DEBTOR: they hold our money, so what they owe is a Debit balance.
 * A vendor is a CREDITOR: we hold theirs, so what we owe is a Credit balance.
 *
 *   CUSTOMER (receivable)              VENDOR (payable)
 *   invoice issued      → Dr           bill received       → Cr
 *   payment received    → Cr           payment made        → Dr
 *   credit note         → Cr           vendor credit note  → Dr
 *   debit note          → Dr           —
 *   refund to customer  → Dr
 *   Dr closing = they owe us           Cr closing = we owe them
 *   Cr closing = we hold an advance    Dr closing = we paid ahead
 *
 * Every entry is therefore stored SIGNED against one convention — positive means "the
 * party owes us more" — and `side()` maps that to the Dr or Cr column depending on which
 * ledger is being read. One sign convention internally, two presentations. The
 * alternative (a `debit` and a `credit` field per row, filled by the caller) is what
 * produces a vendor statement with a customer's signs, because nothing in the types
 * stops it.
 *
 * ─── WHY A DEBIT AND A CREDIT COLUMN AT ALL, IF ONE NUMBER WOULD DO ─────────
 * Because a CA reads this, and Tally prints it this way. A single signed column is
 * easier to compute and unreadable to the person who has to reconcile it against their
 * own books. The engine keeps one number; the table shows two.
 *
 * ─── OPENING BALANCE IS NOT ZERO, AND GETTING IT WRONG IS SILENT ────────────
 * A statement for "FY 2026-27" that starts at zero claims the party had no history
 * before 1 April — which is false for every party that existed last year, and the error
 * shows up as a closing balance that disagrees with the customer's own ledger by exactly
 * the amount they carried forward. So `buildLedger` takes ALL entries and the period, and
 * derives the opening balance from everything before the window. Callers must not
 * pre-filter by date.
 *
 * ─── WHOLE RUPEES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every amount in and out is an integer rupee (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md §13). No division
 * happens here, so nothing can drift; `assertWholeRupees` exists so a caller feeding
 * paise fails loudly instead of producing a statement that is 100× wrong and looks
 * plausible.
