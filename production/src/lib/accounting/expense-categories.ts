 * Kharche ki categories — ek hi jagah, aur ye file JAAN-BOOJHKAR khaali hai.
 *
 * Ye `lib/queries/expenses.ts` me thi, jo Supabase aur react-query import karti hai. 30 Aug
 * 2026 ko bill-extractor ke sanitiser ko ye list chahiye thi, aur us file ke sir par likha
 * hai: "Pure, dependency-free helpers … so they can be unit-tested without pulling in
 * server-only Supabase/Gemini imports". Us waade ko todne se behtar tha list ko us jagah
 * rakhna jahan se dono le sakein.
 *
 * `expenses.ts` ise aage bhi export karti hai, isliye maujooda 11 call site waise hi chalte
 * hain — kisi ko badalne ki zaroorat nahi.
