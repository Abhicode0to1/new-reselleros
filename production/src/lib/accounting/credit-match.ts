/**
 * Matching a bank CREDIT to the quote it probably paid.
 *
 * ─── THE GAP THIS FILLS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `suggest_bank_transaction_matches` already proposes candidates for a credit — but only
 * against `payments` and `project_payments`, i.e. money somebody has ALREADY RECORDED.
 * The case that actually strands a deposit is the opposite one:
 *
 *   The customer pays by UPI or NEFT straight into the bank. No payment row exists yet.
 *   So the credit has nothing to match against, and it sits unreconciled for ever.
 *
 * That is not an edge case for an Indian reseller, it is the normal path — and it got
 * MORE normal the day we started putting a `upi://pay` link in the reminder. On ANUTECH's
 * live books this is ₹4.6 lakh across 9 deposits, every one of them older than a week.
 * Cash balance correct, ledger wrong, every revenue report understated.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS TYPESCRIPT AND NOT SQL ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The existing suggester is a Postgres RPC and extending it would be the tidier home.
 * It also could not ship today: applying a migration needs write access this checkout
 * does not have. This runs over data the client already fetches, so the feature works
 * now; folding it into the RPC later changes nothing a caller can see.
 *
 * ─── THE NAME IN THE NARRATION IS THE STRONGEST SIGNAL, NOT THE AMOUNT ──────
 * Amount-and-date matching is what everyone builds first and it is the weaker half. Two
 * customers on the same monthly plan produce identical amounts on the same day, and a
 * confident wrong match posts money against the wrong customer — which is worse than no
 * match, because nobody goes back to check a reconciled line.
 *
 * A bank narration usually says WHO paid:
 *
 *   UPI-MUKUL BHARDWAJ-9896033878-2@AXL-BARB
 *   IMPS-519009330625-DARSHAN KUMAR-HDFC-XXXXXXX
 *
 * A name hit plus an amount hit is near-certain. An amount hit alone is a guess worth
 * showing and never worth applying by itself — which is why `confidence` is returned and
 * nothing in this module writes anything.
 *
 * ─── NOTHING IS EVER AUTO-APPLIED ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * This proposes. A human confirms. The 1-click button in the UI is one click for the
 * OPERATOR, not one click the machine takes on its own — a mis-posted receipt has to be
 * unwound through a credit note, and the customer sees it.
