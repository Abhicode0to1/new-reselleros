/**
 * From what reached the bank back to the invoice, when the customer withheld TDS.
 *
 * TDS is deducted on the value BEFORE GST (CBDT Circular 23/2017, when GST is shown
 * separately), so a receipt of `net` is:
 *
 *     net = taxable × (1 + gst%) − taxable × tds%   →   taxable = net ÷ (1 + gst% − tds%)
 *
 * Excel Technologies: ₹5,40,000 ÷ (1 + 0.18 − 0.10) = ₹5,00,000 taxable → ₹5,90,000 invoice,
 * ₹50,000 TDS. TDS is taken as gross − net, so the three always add up to the rupee.
