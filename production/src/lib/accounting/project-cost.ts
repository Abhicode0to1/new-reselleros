/**
 * Project delivery cost — the salary spent building a customer's software, moved out of
 * operating expenses and into cost of goods, where it belongs.
 *
 * ─── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A developer's salary while they build a customer's project is the cost of THAT sale,
 * exactly as a Google licence is the cost of a Workspace sale. Left in "Operating
 * expenses" it makes every project look like 100% gross margin and every month look like
 * overhead. The project page already records who worked on what (`project_labour`:
 * employee, % of their time, months, dates); the company P&L simply never read it.
 *
 * ─── IT IS A RECLASSIFICATION, NEVER AN ADDITION ────────────────────────────
 * Salaries are booked once, as `expenses` rows. Whatever this module puts into cost of
 * goods is taken OUT of operating expenses by the same amount — net profit does not move
 * by a rupee. And it can never move more than was actually booked as salary in the
 * period: an allocation says "60% of Ranjeet's time", not "the company paid ₹21,000 this
 * month". If payroll for the period is not booked yet, the allocation is capped to what
 * is, and the cap is reported rather than hidden.
 *
 * ─── WHAT COUNTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - Labour: employees.monthly_gross × percent% × the months of that allocation falling
 *   inside the period. An allocation runs from its start_date (else the project's) to its
 *   end_date (else start + `months`). With no date at all it cannot be placed in any
 *   period, so it is counted as UNDATED and left out — never spread by guess.
 * - Direct costs: any expense tagged with a project_id (hosting, a freelancer, a tool
 *   bought for that client). Those are cost of goods whatever their category.
 *
 * Whole rupees in and out; rounded once per allocation line.
