/**
 * Access register — WHICH credentials exist, never what they are.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS NOT A PASSWORD MANAGER, AND MUST NOT BECOME ONE ─────────────
 * A password vault in this app cannot keep its own promise. `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`
 * is a server-side environment variable, so anyone with the Cloud Run environment
 * or the Supabase service-role key can decrypt every row. Bitwarden and 1Password
 * derive the key from the user's master password IN THE BROWSER, so the server
 * holds ciphertext it cannot open. That is zero-knowledge, and it is an
 * architecture rather than a feature — bolting it on here would mean no
 * server-side reads, no admin recovery, no RLS team sharing, and audited crypto.
 *
 * So this register stores metadata and nothing else. There is deliberately NO
 * column for a secret value: the guarantee is structural, not a promise in a
 * comment. What it answers is the question a ten-person reseller actually has —
 * who holds the GST portal login, when was the bank password last changed, and
 * whose DSC expires next month.
 *
 * The one hole left is a human typing a password into `notes`, which
 * `looksLikeSecret` exists to catch before it is saved.
