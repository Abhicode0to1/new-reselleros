/**
 * A project sale, read as the QUOTATION it started life as — R-006 (Pardeep, 25 Sep 2026).
 *
 * ─── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A project's quotation lives on `project_sales` itself: status `quoted` becomes
 * `active` on acceptance, the line items hang off the same row, and the customer sees
 * it at `/project-quote/<id>?t=<token>`. There is no row in `quotes`.
 *
 * So Customer 360 -> Transactions -> Quotes showed only `quotes` rows, and for a
 * software client like Excel Technologies that meant an empty tab next to a deal that
 * was very much quoted. The owner reads that as "nobody ever sent them a quote".
 *
 * ─── WHY NOT JUST COPY THEM INTO `quotes` ───────────────────────────────────
 * Pardeep's request says it plainly and he is right: a copy would double them in the
 * quote pipeline and in Customer 360, and then the two rows would drift. This maps the
 * project's own status onto quote language at the point of DISPLAY. Nothing is written.
