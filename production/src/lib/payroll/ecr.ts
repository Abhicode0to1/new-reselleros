/**
 * EPFO ECR (Electronic Challan-cum-Return) — the text file the unified portal
 * imports for a month's PF, one line per member.
 *
 * Format (ECR 2.0, ".txt", fields joined by "#~#", no header):
 *   UAN #~# Member name #~# Gross wages #~# EPF wages #~# EPS wages #~# EDLI wages
 *   #~# EPF contribution (EE) #~# EPS contribution (ER) #~# EPF-EPS diff (ER)
 *   #~# NCP days #~# Refund of advances
 *
 * Wages: EPF wages are the PF wage the payslip was computed on (Basic + DA, prorated);
 * EPS and EDLI wages are that, capped at the ceiling for the month (lib/payroll/pf.ts).
 * Contributions: EE = employee PF as deducted; EPS = 8.33% of EPS wages; the employer's
 * remaining share (employer PF − EPS) goes in the diff column. NCP = loss-of-pay days.
 * Admin (0.5%) and EDLI (0.5%) charges are computed by the portal from the totals.
 *
 * A member with no UAN cannot be uploaded: the row is left out and named in `skipped`
 * so nobody files a short return without knowing.
