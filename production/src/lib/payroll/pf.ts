/**
 * PF (Employees' Provident Fund / EPF) — statutory retirement contribution.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for PF rates + ceiling. Mirrors esi.ts. If EPFO revises
 * rates or the wage ceiling, change them HERE only.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   • PF wages are capped at the statutory ceiling for the month being paid:
 *     ₹15,000 up to Sep 2026, ₹25,000 from the October 2026 salary onwards
 *     (Pardeep, 27 Sep 2026). Contribution is computed on min(wage, ceiling).
 *   • Employee contributes 12% of PF wages; employer contributes 12%
 *     (internally 8.33% EPS + 3.67% EPF — but the total employer cost is 12%).
 *   • Employer also pays small admin/EDLI charges (~1%) which are NOT modelled in
 *     v1 — the employer figure here is the 12% contribution only. Adjust the
 *     "employer PF" field manually if you want to include admin/EDLI.
 *   • Applies to employees the owner marks PF-applicable (has an EPFO account).
 *
 * ─── WHY THE CEILING IS A DATED TABLE ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A single constant would re-compute every OLD payslip at the new ceiling the day
 * it changed — August's PF would print differently in November than it did in
 * September, and the ECR already filed for August would no longer match the app.
 * The ceiling is looked up by the salary PERIOD, so a month keeps the ceiling that
 * was law when it was paid, and the next revision is one more row here.
 *
 * Like ESI, employee PF is withheld from net pay; employer PF is an extra
 * company cost that accrues to the statutory payable and is cleared by the PF
 * (ECR) challan — it does not leave the bank at salary time.
