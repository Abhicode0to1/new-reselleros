/**
 * PIN rules — the half of the screen lock that has no crypto in it.
 *
 * SPLIT OUT OF pin.ts BECAUSE OF A REAL BUILD FAILURE, not for tidiness. The lock screen
 * and the settings card are client components and need PIN_LENGTH, the weak-PIN rules and
 * the lockout maths. Importing those from pin.ts dragged `node:crypto` into the browser
 * bundle and webpack refused the whole route with UnhandledSchemeError — a 500 that
 * typecheck, lint and vitest all passed straight over, and only running the app showed.
 *
 * Nothing here touches a secret: no hashing, no salt, no comparison. Those stay in pin.ts,
 * server-side, where they belong.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS PROTECTS AGAINST, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PROTECTS: somebody who walks up to the owner's unlocked laptop, or is looking over
 * their shoulder, or is watching a screen share. That is a real and common threat in a
 * small office, and it is the threat the reporter of this feature has in mind.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROTECT: anybody technical holding a live session. The vault rows are read
 * through PostgREST under RLS, so a person who can open the browser console can fetch
 * them without ever seeing this PIN. **The access control is the RLS policy
 * (`owner_user_id = auth.uid()`), not this.**
 *
 * That gap is not fixable by trying harder here. Encrypting the data under the PIN is
 * the only thing that would close it, and a 4-digit key has 10,000 possibilities — an
 * attacker holding the ciphertext tries all of them in under a second. It would also
 * mean a forgotten PIN destroys the data permanently. So the PIN stays a screen lock,
 * the UI says so in plain words, and nobody is misled into thinking their net worth is
 * encrypted when it is not.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IS STILL WORTH DOING PROPERLY ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Given it exists, it should not be a *bad* screen lock:
 *   · the PIN is never stored, only a salted scrypt hash, and never leaves the server
 *   · comparison is timing-safe
 *   · guesses are counted and locked out — 10,000 possibilities is seconds of scripted
 *     guessing without a limit, which would make the lock decorative even against the
 *     shoulder-surfer it is for
 *   · obvious PINs are refused at the point of setting, because "1234" is not a lock
