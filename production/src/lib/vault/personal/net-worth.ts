/**
 * Personal net worth — what the owner is actually worth, from hand-entered figures.
 *
 * ─── EVERY NUMBER HERE IS SOMETHING A PERSON TYPED ──────────────────────────
 * Nothing in this feature talks to a market feed, an AMC, or a bank. A portfolio total
 * is therefore only as true as the last time somebody updated it, and a big confident
 * figure computed from a value typed six months ago is worse than no figure — it gets
 * used to make a decision. So every total comes back with how stale its inputs are, and
 * the UI is expected to show that, not bury it.
 *
 * ─── SIGNS LIVE IN ONE PLACE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A credit card balance is stored POSITIVE and is subtracted here. The alternative —
 * storing card debt negative — means the sign convention has to be remembered by every
 * form, every import and every report, and the first place that forgets turns a ₹80,000
 * debt into ₹80,000 of assets, a ₹1.6L swing in the wrong direction.
 *
 * All amounts are whole rupees.
