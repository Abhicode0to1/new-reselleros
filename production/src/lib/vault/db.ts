/**
 * Typed access to the vault tables before their migration is applied.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS SHIM EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` is GENERATED FROM THE LIVE DATABASE. Migration
 * 0234 has not been applied yet, so as far as TypeScript is concerned
 * `vault_passwords` and `vault_access_log` do not exist, and every query against
 * them is a compile error.
 *
 * That is a real ordering problem, not a nuisance: in this project the operator
 * applies migrations by hand, so code has to be written and reviewed BEFORE the
 * schema exists. The alternatives were worse — scattering `as unknown as` casts
 * through the route handlers (three already exist elsewhere in the codebase, and
 * each one is a place where a typo in a column name compiles fine), or holding
 * the feature until someone runs the SQL.
 *
 * So the row shapes are written out by hand here, once, matching 0234 exactly.
 * They are a claim about the schema that a reviewer can check against the
 * migration file side by side, which is more than a cast gives you.
 *
 * ─── DELETE THIS FILE WHEN 0234 IS APPLIED ───────────────────────────────────
 * Once the migration is live and `types.ts` is regenerated, these tables appear
 * in the generated types and this shim becomes a way for the code to disagree
 * with the database without anything failing. Remove it and import the generated
 * types instead.
