/**
 * The billing-period choice, and the 12× it is one mistake away from.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE IS MOSTLY ABOUT ONE NUMBER ───────────────────────────────
 * `billingTerms().periods` decides what the quote STORES, and the rule is not
 * symmetric:
 *
 *   monthly_flex    → 1   the stored figures ARE one month
 *   annual_monthly  → 12  the stored figures are the YEAR, split by quoteInstalments
 *   annual_yearly   → 1   one invoice, the year
 *
 * Get it backwards either way and money moves by 12×:
 *
 *  • `12` on flex re-creates the defect measured 1 Sep 2026 — a ₹5,753/month flex
 *    quote whose pay button asked for ₹479, because quoteInstalments divided figures
 *    that were already per-month. (lib/billing/instalments.ts documents that it
 *    returns null for commitment 'monthly' precisely to stop this.)
 *  • `1` on annual_monthly is the same bug inverted: instalments would divide an
 *    already-monthly amount by 12 and bill a twelfth of one month.
 *
 * The other thing pinned here is that FLEX IS ITS OWN PRICE. `prices.monthly` is a
 * higher rate, not `prices.annual`, and not annual ÷ 12. Substituting the annual rate
 * gives the flexibility premium away on every cancel-any-time deal, invisibly — so
 * when the catalogue has no flex price the terms must SAY so rather than pretend.
