 * ─── THE ₹4 THAT NOBODY AGREED TO ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reported live: a support plan quoted at ₹2,000 a year showed as "Annual · ₹2,004".
 * Nothing was corrupt. `subscriptions` stores only a MONTHLY figure, so ₹2,000/yr became
 * mrr = round(2000 / 12) = 167, and the page rebuilt the annual as 167 × 12 = 2,004. The
 * ₹4 was invented by the round trip.
 *
 * It is invisible on most rows, which is what makes it nasty: ₹45,360 a year divides
 * evenly by 12, so the Google line on the same screen was exactly right while the support
 * line beside it was wrong. Any annual price not divisible by 12 is out by up to ₹11 —
 * enough for a customer to query a renewal invoice against the quote they signed.
 *
 * ─── SO THE CONTRACTED AMOUNT IS PREFERRED, AND THE REST IS LABELLED ────────
 * A subscription raised from a quote carries `quote_id`, and that quote's line still holds
 * the negotiated annual `rate`. When the caller can supply it, that is the number — exact,
 * to the rupee. When it cannot (a subscription entered by hand, or an older row), the
 * monthly × months answer is still shown, but flagged `exact: false` so the screen can say
 * "about" instead of asserting a precision it does not have.
 *
 * Storing the annual figure would fix this properly and needs a migration; until then, not
 * lying about it is the part that can be done today.
