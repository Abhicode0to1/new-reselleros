/**
 * Does this quote's subscription actually exist?
 *
 * ─── WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT THIS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A subscription is what makes a paid deal keep earning: it carries the renewal date,
 * the seat count and the MRR, and it is the row the renewal cron chases. Delete it — by
 * accident, or while tidying up test data — and the money does not stop, it just stops
 * being *known*. The customer keeps their mailboxes, the reseller keeps paying the
 * vendor, and nothing ever asks for the renewal. It is the quietest way this product can
 * lose a customer's annual revenue.
 *
 * ─── AN ABSENT SUBSCRIPTION IS USUALLY CORRECT, WHICH IS THE HARD PART ──────
 * An accepted quote with no money against it SHOULD have no subscription: `record_payment`
 * creates it when the money arrives. Two of ANUTECH's live accepted quotes are exactly
 * that shape (Q-2026-9776 and Q-2026-9778, both unpaid), and flagging them would train
 * the operator to ignore this warning before it ever caught a real one.
 *
 * So "missing" is only claimed when the subscription is DUE: money received, and the
 * quote is a new sale rather than a renewal or an add-seats top-up, both of which
 * deliberately attach to a subscription that already exists.
 *
 * ─── AND IT COUNTS, RATHER THAN ASKING "IS THERE ONE?" ──────────────────────
 * One quote can create SEVERAL subscriptions — a licence line plus a support-plan line is
 * the normal shape here, and three of ANUTECH's quotes carry exactly two. I nearly read
 * those as duplicates; they are one atomic write, to the microsecond.
 *
 * The consequence is that a check for "zero subscriptions" would miss the more likely
 * accident: two were created, one got deleted. That half-loss is worse than a total one,
 * because the quote still looks connected. So this compares the count of
 * subscription-worthy LINES against the subscriptions that exist.
