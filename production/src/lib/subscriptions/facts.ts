/**
 * The handful of facts a subscription drawer has to state before anything else.
 *
 * ─── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Abhishek, 19 Sep 2026: clicking a subscription row opened the CUSTOMER page, which is
 * a different object — it lists all of that customer's subscriptions, invoices and
 * payments, and nothing on it says which row you clicked. The row now opens the billing
 * drawer instead, which is about the subscription.
 *
 * But that drawer was built as a schedule forecast, not as a detail view: it showed the
 * plan, the domain, the projected billing dates and the amendment history, and none of
 * seats, revenue, status or what is owed. Reached from a MENU that was fine — you had
 * just read the row, so you knew those. Reached by clicking the row it now replaces, the
 * omission reads as "this subscription has no seats".
 *
 * ─── WHY A PURE FUNCTION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every line here is a small formatting decision with a wrong answer that looks right:
 * 0 of 5 seats used is not "no data", an unknown seat count is not zero, and a paused
 * subscription still owing money must not read as settled. Those are worth testing, and
 * they cannot be tested inside a drawer that needs a Sheet, a router and a query client
 * to render.
