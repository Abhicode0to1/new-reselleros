/**
 * Subscription exception flags — the facts that stay invisible until they matter.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PURE FUNCTION AND NOT JUST JSX. Measured against production on
 * 13 Aug 2026: across all 54 of the tenant's subscriptions, `auto_renew` is true
 * on every row, `renewal_state` is 'pending' on every row, and `reminder_count`,
 * `outstanding_amount`, `used`, `suspended_at` and `written_off_at` are
 * zero/empty on every row.
 *
 * So NONE of these branches render in production today. A bug in any of them
 * would be invisible on screen — which is precisely the failure mode this
 * project keeps hitting: built, looks configured, does nothing. Pulling the
 * decision out of the component is what makes it testable at all.
 *
 * WHY CONDITIONAL RATHER THAN ALWAYS-ON. Rendering these unconditionally would
 * put 54 identical badges on screen: pure noise, zero information. Rendering
 * them only on deviation costs nothing today and makes each one the loudest
 * thing on the row the day it goes wrong.
