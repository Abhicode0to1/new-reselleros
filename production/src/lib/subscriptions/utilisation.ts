/**
 * Seat utilisation and the churn risk it implies.
 *
 * ─── `used` IS ZERO ON EVERY ROW IN THIS DATABASE ───────────────────────────
 * Every insert path writes `used: 0` — add-subscription, both importers — and
 * NOTHING ever updates it. Verified against production: 1 subscription, 10 seats,
 * 0 used.
 *
 * So the brief's rule taken literally — "flag subs with <60% seat usage as High Churn
 * Risk" — flags 100% of subscriptions. A red badge on everything is a badge people
 * stop seeing within a day, and it would be asserting that customers are not using
 * licences they are almost certainly using.
 *
 * lib/subscriptions/exceptions.ts already reached this conclusion and gates its own
 * idle-seat warning on `used > 0` for the same reason. This module follows the same
 * rule and makes the distinction explicit rather than implicit: `used = 0` with no
 * recorded sync is UNKNOWN, not 0%.
 *
 * ─── WHICH MEANS THE USEFUL OUTPUT IS THE GAP ITSELF ────────────────────────
 * Until something populates `used`, the honest churn-risk report is "we cannot see
 * utilisation on N subscriptions", with what would fix it. That is a real finding —
 * a reseller who believes they are watching utilisation and is not, is worse off than
 * one who knows they are blind.
 *
 * The seat count comes from Google Admin (assigned users), which is a DIFFERENT
 * export from the reseller console's "Purchased licenses" that feeds
 * `vendor_seats` — those are what we PAY for. Conflating them is the mistake
 * lib/vendor/leakage.ts exists to prevent.
