/**
 * MRR / ARR and margin by product line, from the subscriptions table as it actually is.
 *
 * Rewritten 2 Oct 2026 (Pardeep: "theek karke push"). The first version read columns the
 * database does not have (subscriptions.quantity, items.category) — the endpoint answered
 * every call with a 500 that printed the Postgres error — and it re-priced each
 * subscription from the catalogue MSRP, treating half-yearly and quarterly as monthly.
 *
 * What it reads now:
 *   · revenue  = subscriptions.mrr — the monthly figure stored on the subscription, the
 *                same number the Customers page totals. Not re-derived from a list price:
 *                a customer's agreed price is not the catalogue's.
 *   · cost     = vendor_cost_per_seat_month × seats, when the vendor sync has filled it.
 *                Nothing else in the database states a per-month cost reliably, so a
 *                subscription without it is counted in `cost_unknown`, and margin is
 *                computed only over subscriptions whose cost IS known — never a guess.
 *   · line     = subscriptions.vendor (google / microsoft / zoho / hosting / domain / …).
 * Whole rupees throughout (AGENTS.md rule 1).
