/**
 * Grading an incoming lead, and deciding what happens to it next.
 *
 * ─── THE BRIEF HAS ONE GRADE BACKWARDS, AND IT IS THE COMMERCIALLY EXPENSIVE ONE ──
 * It asks for "Grade D: single personal Gmail ID, vague inquiry" — nurture loop, lowest
 * priority. Two independent signals are bundled into one grade there, and separating them
 * reverses half of it.
 *
 * WE SELL BUSINESS EMAIL. A company writing from `sharmatraders@gmail.com` has not bought what
 * we sell — the entire need is unmet, and there is no incumbent, no migration, and nobody else's
 * contract in the way. A company writing from `rahul@sharmatraders.in` ALREADY has business
 * email, from a competitor, and winning them means a switch: moving live mailboxes, unpicking a
 * renewal, and beating a supplier they have not left yet.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §1 says who this platform is for — Indian cloud resellers selling to SMEs. The SME
 * whose owner runs the business off a free mailbox is the textbook prospect for a first
 * Workspace purchase. Grading them D and dropping them into a nurture loop deprioritises the
 * easiest sale in the pipeline.
 *
 * So a free mailbox is NOT a negative signal here. It is a DEAL-SHAPE signal: new purchase
 * rather than switch. What the brief was actually reaching for is the other half of its own
 * sentence — "vague inquiry" — and vagueness is a real negative signal on its own, whatever the
 * address it arrives from. The two are scored separately below.
 *
 * The address does say something about SIZE: a company large enough to have bought its own
 * domain is usually a bigger deal than one that has not. That is why `hasBusinessDomain` still
 * scores, just far less than the brief implied, and never below zero.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THE GRADE IS ALLOWED TO TOUCH ─────────────────────────────────────
 * ROUTING ONLY. NEVER THE PROMPT.
 *
 * A grade is our private opinion of how much a stranger is worth. It decides who gets a call and
 * who gets an email, and it never reaches `buildSalesAgentPrompt`, because a model told "this is
 * a Grade D lead" will write to them like one — and the customer will feel it. There is no
 * version of that leak that is recoverable, so the boundary is structural: this module exports a
 * route, not prompt lines, and nothing here is imported by sales-agent.ts.
 *
 * ─── AND THE A+ ACTIONS COLLIDE WITH RULES THAT ALREADY EXIST ───────────────
 * The brief pairs Grade A+ with "instant WhatsApp quote + AI telecalling within 10 seconds".
 * Measured against what is already built:
 *
 *   · A QUOTE NEEDS A TERM. Monthly and annual differ by twelve times. "25+ seats and high
 *     intent" says nothing about which, and `mergeQualification` will not price without it. So
 *     the A+ route is "quote if it is quotable, otherwise ask the one missing question" — which
 *     for a hot lead is the faster path anyway, because a wrong-term quote costs a re-quote.
 *
 *   · 51+ SEATS IS HELD FOR A PERSON. `REVIEW_ABOVE_SEATS` is 50: 51–100 seats are priced and
 *     drafted in full and then held. So a 60-seat A+ lead gets the REVIEW path, not the instant
 *     one — the highest grade legitimately gets the slowest route, because that is the band
 *     where the discount conversation is the deal.
 *
 *   · "WITHIN 10 SECONDS" CANNOT BE PROMISED OR DONE. `decideTelecall` obeys
 *     `quietHoursDecision`, `MIN_HOURS_BETWEEN_CALLS` (24) and `MAX_CALL_ATTEMPTS` (3), because
 *     TRAI's TCCCPR governs when a business may ring a stranger. An enquiry at 22:45 does not
 *     get a call at 22:45. This module marks a lead CALL-ELIGIBLE and lets `decideTelecall`
 *     choose the moment; it never carries a delay of its own.
 *
 *     Separately: the phrase itself is now refused in a draft. `findPromises` catches "10
 *     seconds" and "10 second" as of the duration fix earlier today, so an agent that offered it
 *     would have its reply held.
