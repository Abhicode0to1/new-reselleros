   Darshan's report, 24 Aug 2026: "Customer ko quotation sent kar di lekin Quote sent mein
   show nahi kar raha."

   He was right. "Quote Sent" is a lead STAGE (folders.ts: `l.stage === "quote"`), and the
   only place in the whole codebase that ever set it was the public buy-page checkout. The
   operator's Send button, the auto-quote from an inbound email and renewals never touched
   it — so the quote really went and the column named after that act stayed empty.
