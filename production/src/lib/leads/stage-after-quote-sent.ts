/**
 * A quote just went to the customer. Should the lead move to "Quote Sent"?
 *
 * ─── THE BUG, REPORTED BY THE PERSON IT COST ────────────────────────────────
 * Darshan, 24 Aug 2026: "Customer ko quotation sent kar di lekin Quote sent mein show nahi
 * kar raha."
 *
 * He was right, and the cause is one line in lib/leads/folders.ts:
 *
 *     case "quoted": return l.is_junk !== true && l.stage === "quote";
 *
 * "Quote Sent" is a lead STAGE, not a fact about quotes. And grepping the whole codebase,
 * the ONLY place that ever set `stage: "quote"` was the public buy-page checkout. Sending a
 * quote from inside the app — the operator's Send button, the auto-quote from an inbound
 * email, a renewal — never touched it. So the quote really went, and the column named after
 * that act stayed empty.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS ALLOWED TO WRITE, WHEN THE MORNING'S ANSWER WAS "DO NOT" ───
 * Earlier the same day Pardeep chose, from four options with the costs stated, that the app
 * should NOT advance a stage by itself — it should nudge. That decision stands, and this is
 * not an exception to it. It is the same rule.
 *
 * The rule is: automation opens on a FACT, never on a guess. "An activity was logged" is a
 * guess about what it meant — a call might have been a wrong number. "A quote was emailed to
 * this customer" is not a guess at all; it is precisely, exactly, the thing the words "Quote
 * Sent" describe. Refusing to write there would not be caution, it would be a column that
 * lies about its own name.
 *
 * ─── FORWARD ONLY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE RISK ───────────────────────────────
 * The funnel is new → contact → demo → trial → quote → won. An upsell quote to a WON
 * customer, or a fresh quote on a lead someone marked LOST, must not drag it backwards into
 * the pipeline — that would corrupt the board, the stage-age badge and the forecast, all of
 * which read the stage. Every refusal below is a backwards move.
