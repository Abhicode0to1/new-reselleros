/**
 * What becomes irreversible when an invoice is issued, in the operator's words.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Issuing a GST tax invoice was a single unconfirmed click. `/invoices` had a
 * "Generate" button wired straight to `generateInvoice.mutate(q.id)`, and a BULK
 * action that looped it over every selected quote — so one click could burn a run
 * of serial numbers. Nothing on screen said what the click did.
 *
 * Two things make that worse than it looks:
 *
 *   1. Since 20260823090000 an issued invoice genuinely CANNOT be edited. Before
 *      that guard the click was recoverable by a quiet UPDATE; now the only
 *      correction is a credit note plus a fresh invoice (CGST Section 34). The
 *      screen must say so before the click, not after.
 *   2. The serial number is consumed and never reused. `invoice_delete_no_serial_reuse`
 *      (migration 0118) retires a deleted invoice's number, because CGST Rule 46
 *      forbids two supplies sharing one. So a mistaken issue leaves a permanent hole.
 *
 * ─── AND IT SHOWS THE NUMBER, WHICH IS ITS OWN ALARM ────────────────────────
 * Measured 23 Aug 2026: ANUTECH has **zero** invoices and its FY2627 series sits at
 * **32**. Thirty-two numbers consumed, every one of those invoices since deleted. An
 * operator who has never issued an invoice, shown "this will take
 * INV-ADPL-2026-27-0033", learns something no summary would have told them. That is
 * the point of naming the number rather than saying "a number will be used".
 *
 * Pure and display-only: it decides nothing and writes nothing. `next_document_number`
 * remains the only thing that allocates, so the predicted number is a PREDICTION —
 * a concurrent issue can take it first, and `predictedIsCertain` says as much.

  /* ── THE BUYER'S GSTIN — A REMINDER, NEVER A BLOCK ───────────────────────
     Asked for by Pardeep on 30 Aug 2026, and he framed it exactly right: a GSTIN is
     not needed to QUOTE, and it is not compulsory on an invoice either, "kyoki kai
     logo ke pass gst number hota hi nahi".

     He is right in law as well as in practice. CGST Rule 46(b)/(f) asks for the
     recipient's GSTIN **where the recipient is registered**; a supply to an
     unregistered person is a valid B2C tax invoice without one. Refusing to issue
     would block a whole class of real customers.

     But it matters, and only in one direction: a registered buyer whose GSTIN is
     missing from the invoice **cannot claim the input tax credit**, and the invoice
     cannot be edited afterwards (see the second consequence above). The correction is
     a credit note and a fresh invoice. That is worth one line before the click, and
     nothing after it.

     `undefined` — the caller did not tell us — says nothing rather than guessing.
     Silence is right there: a made-up warning on every invoice is a warning nobody
     reads, and this one has to be readable on the day it is true. */
