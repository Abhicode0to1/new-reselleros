/**
 * Is this tenant allowed to issue a tax invoice yet?
 *
 * ─── THE BUG THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The invoice dialog used to do this:
 *
 *     const meTenant = me || {
 *       tenantName: "Excel Technologies Pvt Ltd",
 *       tenantGstin: "27AABCE9876D1Z3",
 *       tenantStateCode: "27", …
 *     };
 *
 * A fallback that looks harmless and is not. Three separate problems, worst last:
 *
 *   1. Wrong company. Excel Technologies is HISTORICAL (CLAUDE.md §1) — the entity
 *      is ANUTECH DIGITAL PVT LTD. A customer receiving that invoice sees a supplier
 *      they have no relationship with.
 *
 *   2. A FABRICATED GSTIN. `27AABCE9876D1Z3` belongs to nobody. On a document headed
 *      "Tax Invoice" that is not a placeholder, it is a false declaration — and the
 *      customer will try to claim input credit against it and fail.
 *
 *   3. THE TAX SPLIT FLIPS. This is the expensive one. `tenantStateCode` decides
 *      inter-state vs intra-state (isInterStateSupply, lib/gst/place-of-supply.ts).
 *      ANUTECH is Delhi, **07**. The fallback claims Maharashtra, **27**. So for a
 *      Delhi customer — an intra-state sale that must carry CGST 9% + SGST 9% — the
 *      fallback makes 07 ≠ 27 and the invoice charges **IGST 18%** instead.
 *
 *      Same total rupees, wrong tax heads, and the wrong government gets paid. The
 *      customer's GSTR-2B will not reconcile, and correcting it means a credit note
 *      plus a fresh invoice, not an edit.
 *
 * And it only appears while `useCurrentUser` is in flight — a deep link into an
 * invoice on a slow connection — so it is invisible in testing and reproducible in
 * front of a customer.
 *
 * ─── THE RULE: NEVER INVENT A TAX IDENTITY ──────────────────────────────────
 * An unknown identity is reported, never substituted. There is no safe default for
 * "who is selling this" — every possible guess is a false statement on a legal
 * document. `null` and a named list of what is missing is the honest answer, and it
 * is the only one that leads the operator to the fix.
 *
 * Fields are the ones CGST Rule 46 requires of the supplier: name, address, GSTIN,
 * and the state + code that determine place of supply.
