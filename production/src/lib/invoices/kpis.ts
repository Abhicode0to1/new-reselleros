/**
 * R-062 — the money tiles on /invoices, as one pure function.
 *
 * ─── WHAT WAS CHECKED (1 Oct 2026, local data) ──────────────────────────────
 * The AI tester read "two invoices paid ₹5.9L each, but September GST shows one and
 * Collected MTD ₹5.9L" as a bug. It is not: INV-FBB9-2026-27-0001 is dated 7 Aug and was
 * settled 7 Aug; only -0003 (26 Sep) belongs to September, and -0002 is void. GST counts
 * by INVOICE date, this tile by PAID date. Both said ₹5.9L / 1 invoice for September.
 *
 * ─── WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * · Outstanding summed every invoice whose status was not 'paid' — so a VOID invoice
 *   (and a draft) counted as money owed. INV-1111-2026-27-0001 (void, net_payable
 *   ₹5,40,000) made that tenant's Outstanding read ₹5.4L when nothing is owed.
 *   It also ignored `paid_amount`, so a half-paid project milestone read as fully owed.
 * · The month test used `new Date(paid_date).getMonth()` — the BROWSER's month of a UTC
 *   midnight, so on a machine west of UTC a payment on the 1st fell into last month.
 *   Now a string compare against the IST month, the same way every other screen does it.
