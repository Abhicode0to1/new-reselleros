/**
 * R-015 — the document number's shape exists in TWO implementations, and they must agree.
 *
 *   SQL  public.format_document_number  — mints the number that is actually stored
 *   TS   formatDocumentNumber           — predicts it for the operator, before they spend it
 *
 * The TS one is shown in the "Issue invoice?" dialog as *the number you are about to
 * use up*. If it drifts, the operator is warned about one number and the books get
 * another — a wrong figure that looks authoritative, which AGENTS.md §2 is entirely
 * about. There is no way to share the code across the two runtimes, so the agreement is
 * pinned here instead: the same worked examples, plus a scan of the SQL for the one
 * expression that distinguishes the new shape from the old.
