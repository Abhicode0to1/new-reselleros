/**
 * Co-terming — making an add-on renew on the same day as the customer's main plan.
 *
 * ─── WHY IT MATTERS COMMERCIALLY ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A customer with Workspace renewing on 1 April who buys a backup add-on on 20
 * September now has two renewal dates, two invoices, two chase sequences and two
 * chances to lapse. Co-terming charges the add-on only to 1 April — a short first
 * period — after which both renew together, for ever.
 *
 * ─── THE SHORT-STUB RULE IS A DECISION, NOT A DETAIL ────────────────────────
 * If the add-on is bought a few days before the anniversary, the aligned first period
 * is a few days long. Billing ₹43 for it, raising a GST invoice, and chasing payment
 * costs more than the money. So a stub shorter than MIN_STUB_DAYS is folded into the
 * FOLLOWING year instead: the customer gets those days free and the first invoice
 * covers a full year plus the stub.
 *
 * That is a giveaway, and it is deliberate and bounded — never more than 30 days of
 * one add-on. The alternative that looks tidier, charging the stub anyway, produces
 * an invoice a customer queries and a rep spends an hour explaining.
 *
 * ─── ALL ARITHMETIC GOES THROUGH prorate() ──────────────────────────────────
 * There is no second proration in this file. `prorate()` already rounds once, in
 * integer paise, and handles leap years by taking the real term length — writing
 * another one here is exactly how two parts of a system come to disagree about the
 * same charge.
