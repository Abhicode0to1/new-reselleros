/**
 * Is this quote PDF still an offer, or a receipt for money already taken?
 *
 * R-034 (Pawan, 29 Sep 2026). A customer who pays from the DMS panel gets the
 * quote PDF back as their bill, and it still read "QUOTATION", "Valid until
 * <date>" and "Payment terms: Net 7 days from acceptance" — on an order that was
 * paid minutes earlier (seen on Q-2222-2026-27-0020, ₹708 paid). Three separate
 * sentences all telling a paying customer they still owe the money.
 *
 * The decision lives here rather than inside QuotePDF for the reason the PDF's own
 * `upiQrDataUrl` comment gives: the renderer cannot see payment state, and two
 * copies of "is it paid" is how the header and the footer end up disagreeing.
 * One function, one answer, asserted by a test.

/**
 * Is the money IN, so nothing is owed on this document?

 * `received` — yes. `partial` — no: part of the balance is genuinely still due, so the
 * validity window and the payment terms are still the truth for it.
 *
 * `invoiced` — ONLY when the payments recorded cover the quote. R-159 (5 Oct 2026, Hitesh,
 * Excel Technologies): "I converted a Quote into Invoice without payment. Why is it showing
 * quote paid?" generate_invoice sets payment_status = 'invoiced' whether or not money came
 * (invoicing before payment is allowed — "Invoice now (before payment)"), and this function
 * read 'invoiced' as settled, so an unpaid quote showed a ticked "Paid" step and downloaded
 * as "Paid order" without its payment terms. `payment_amount` is what record_payment writes
 * as the total received; generate_invoice never touches it. ₹1 of rounding is tolerated.
