/**
 * R-034 — a paid order must not download as a quotation.
 *
 * Pawan measured it on Q-2222-2026-27-0020 (₹708, paid): the PDF the customer gets
 * back from the DMS panel said "QUOTATION", carried a "Valid until" date and told them
 * "Net 7 days from acceptance". Three sentences asking for money that had arrived.
 *
 * The decision half is unit-tested here; the RENDERING half is a source scan, because
 * @react-pdf/renderer draws to a PDF buffer and no assertion about the visible words
 * survives that. Same reason `grid-flow-col-reset.test.ts` scans instead of rendering.
