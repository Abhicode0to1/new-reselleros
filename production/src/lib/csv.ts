/**
 * CSV export helpers — shared so every report (GST, P&L, Balance Sheet, …) hands
 * the CA the same, spreadsheet-clean format. Amounts are written as raw integer ₹
 * (the app's canonical money unit), not formatted strings, so Excel/Tally treats
 * them as numbers.
 *
 * ─── TWO THINGS THIS FILE GUARDS AGAINST ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. FORMULA INJECTION. Excel and LibreOffice execute a cell that begins with
 *    `=`, `+`, `@`, or a tab/CR. Customer names, vendor names and note fields are
 *    user-typed and land in these exports, so a customer called `=cmd|'…'!A1`
 *    runs on the CA's laptop when they open the file. Guarded fields get a
 *    leading apostrophe, which spreadsheets strip on display.
 *
 *    `-` is deliberately NOT treated as dangerous on its own: `-4500` is an
 *    ordinary credit in every accounting export here, and quoting it as text
 *    would stop the CA summing the column — breaking the report to prevent a
 *    threat that a leading minus does not actually carry. Only a `-` followed by
 *    something that is not a number is guarded.
 *
 * 2. EXCEL ON WINDOWS AND UTF-8. Without a byte-order mark, Excel reads the file
 *    in the system codepage: `₹` becomes `â‚¹` and any Hindi or accented customer
 *    name turns to mojibake. The BOM is three bytes that make the difference
 *    between a usable export and one the CA emails back.
