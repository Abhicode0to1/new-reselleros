/**
 * Company — how the business is doing this month, one function per team role (1 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Pardeep: "4 team member se AI software company chalana chahta hu". The dashboard's Company
 * section shows one small card per function, and every number links to the screen it sums
 * up. So each number here is computed by the SAME rule that screen uses — either the helper
 * the screen imports, or a helper that the screen now imports from here:
 *
 *   Growth (Pawan)        new leads, from the website ........ /lead-gen  (captureChannel)
 *                         trials started / running ............ /subscriptions → Trials tab
 *   Sales (Pardeep)       won this month, pipeline ............ /deals     (summarizeDealStrip,
 *                                                                           read by the caller)
 *   Money (Hitesh)        invoiced, outstanding, overdue ...... /invoices  (invoiceBucket)
 *                         collected ........................... /payments  (collectedInMonth)
 *   Customers & Ops       new customers ....................... /customers
 *     (Abhishek)          MRR, renewals due ................... /subscriptions (folderCounts)
 *                         open tickets ........................ /support   (its own counts)
 *                         waiting to activate ................. /provisioning (its own counts)
 *
 * "This month" is the IST calendar month (lib/dates/ist.ts), never the browser's clock.
 * Money is read as stored — no GST is recomputed here.
