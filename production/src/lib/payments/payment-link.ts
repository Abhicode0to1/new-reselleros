/**
 * Building a Razorpay payment link for a quote — the decision and the request body.
 *
 * Pure. The HTTP call is in payment-link.server.ts; what may be charged, to whom, and in what
 * unit is decided here where it can be tested against a table.
 *
 * ─── THE ×100 BOUNDARY, WHICH IS THE MOST DANGEROUS LINE IN THIS FILE ───────
 * This schema stores money in WHOLE RUPEES. AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md §13 both say so, and §13
 * says it in a correction because the file used to claim paise — "the most dangerous kind of
 * false: acting on it puts a × 100 or ÷ 100 into money code".
 *
 * Razorpay's API takes PAISE. So this is a genuine unit boundary and it is crossed in exactly
 * one function, `toPaise`, with a test that pins a real quote total. Get it wrong in one
 * direction and we ask a customer for ₹1,46,811 when we meant ₹1,468; in the other, for
 * ₹1,46,81,100. Both are a payment link sent to a real person with a real number on it.
 *
 * ─── AND A TEST-MODE KEY MUST NEVER LOOK LIKE A SALE ────────────────────────
 * Measured on production 25 Aug 2026: `razorpay_key_id` starts `rzp_test_`. A test-mode link
 * accepts a payment, fires `payment.captured`, and settles nothing. The link itself is fine to
 * generate — that is what a sandbox is for — but it must be LABELLED, so nobody reads a test
 * receipt as money in the bank. `decidePaymentLink` says so in the refusal reason rather than
 * quietly proceeding.

 * Whole rupees → paise, the only place this conversion happens.

 * wrong. Rounding is the safe response — a fractional paisa is not a thing Razorpay accepts.
