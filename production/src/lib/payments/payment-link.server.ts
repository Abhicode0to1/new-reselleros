/**
 * Creating a Razorpay payment link for a quote and sending it — the IO half.
 *
 * The decisions are in payment-link.ts: what may be charged, in what unit, and whether a link
 * is allowed at all. This resolves credentials, calls the API, and sends the message through
 * the one chokepoint every customer-facing message in this codebase goes through.
 *
 * ─── THE SEND IS GATED, AND THAT IS WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────
 * `autonomy-chokepoint.test.ts` refused the `payment.link.send` registry entry until something
 * actually passed it to `sendEmail`, on the grounds that "a registry entry nobody enforces is
 * worse than no entry — it reads as a control the operator does not have". It was right: the
 * dial was declared before the wiring existed, and the test caught it in the same minute.
 *
 * So the message goes through `sendEmail` with `automated`, which resolves the dial, records
 * the outcome in `email_log`, and refuses when the kill switch is on. Razorpay's own SMS and
 * email notifications are switched OFF in the request body for the same reason — see
 * `paymentLinkRequest`.
