/**
 * What is actually still owed on an invoice.
 *
 * THIS IS A MONEY FUNCTION. Getting it wrong in one direction asks a customer
 * to pay again for something they have already paid — the single worst bug this
 * product can ship, because it costs the customer real money and costs the
 * reseller the relationship. Getting it wrong in the other direction asks for
 * too little, which is merely annoying and recoverable. So when a value is
 * missing or contradictory, this function biases toward asking for LESS.
 *
 * Two independent things reduce the balance, and they are stored separately:
 *
 *   1. `net_payable` = amount − adjusted advances (migration 0005). Advances are
 *      money taken BEFORE the invoice existed, folded in when it was raised.
 *   2. `paid_amount` = receipts against the invoice AFTER it was raised. Today
 *      only project-milestone receipts land here, via the trigger in migration
 *      0184, whose own column comment states the rule this file implements:
 *      "Outstanding = amount - paid_amount unless status=paid".
 *
 * Subtracting only one of the two — which is what every caller did before this
 * file existed — overstates the balance by the other. In production right now
 * that is INV-ET-2026-27-0013: ₹6,85,000 invoiced, ₹5,40,000 already received,
 * and `net_payable` still reading the full ₹6,85,000.
 *
 * The two are disjoint in practice (advances are consumed at invoice creation;
 * project receipts arrive later), so subtracting both is not double-counting.

 * Rupees still collectable against a QUOTE, for a scan-to-pay QR.

 * A quote is not an invoice and the rules differ in two ways that both matter:
 *
 * 1. CURRENCY. UPI settles in rupees and nothing else. A USD quote for $500 with
 *    `am=500.00` in the intent is not a $500 request — every UPI app reads it as
 *    ₹500. That is a silently wrong amount on a real payment, so a non-INR quote
 *    gets no QR at all rather than a QR that is 98% wrong.
 *
 * 2. WHO OWNS THE ASK. Once a quote has been invoiced, the INVOICE is the payable
 *    document and carries its own QR with its own outstanding balance, computed
 *    from advances and receipts. A QR on the quote as well would be a second
 *    document asking for the same money at a stale amount — the clearest possible
 *    route to being paid twice. So `invoiced` yields nothing here.
 *
 * Returns 0 whenever nothing should be asked for, and 0 means "print no QR".
