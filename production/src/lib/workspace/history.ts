/**
 * Per-tab navigation history, and what to do when the browser's Back button fires.
 *
 * ─── THE SEMANTICS CHOSEN, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE PERFECT ──────────────────────
 * Decision: **Back means "the previous page inside this tab"**, and switching
 * tabs does NOT create a history entry.
 *
 * The brief asked for back/forward to work "100% seamlessly". It cannot, and
 * saying so is more useful than pretending. The browser has ONE history stack and
 * this app now has two notions of "previous": the previous page within a tab, and
 * the previously-active tab. Both cannot occupy one stack.
 *
 * So switching tabs uses `replaceState` (no new entry) and navigating within a tab
 * uses `pushState` (a real entry). That gives the chosen behaviour for as long as
 * the current tab has history left.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT RUNS OUT, stated because it will happen daily: tab A pushes
 * three pages, you switch to tab B and push two. Back twice walks B's history
 * correctly. A third Back lands on an entry that belongs to A — the single stack
 * leaves nowhere else for it to go.
 *
 * Two ways to handle that. Cancelling it by pushing forward again makes Back
 * silently do nothing, and a dead Back button is the kind of thing people stop
 * trusting the whole app over. Instead the owning tab is activated and the page is
 * shown: Back walks out of this tab and into the one you were in before. That is
 * the honest reading of one shared stack, and it is at least predictable.
 *
 * Every function here is pure so the sequence can be tested without a browser.
