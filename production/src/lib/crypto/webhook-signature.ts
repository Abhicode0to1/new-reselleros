/**
 * Webhook signature verification — pure, so the security decision is testable
 * without standing up a route.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The WhatsApp webhook verified its HMAC only when an app
 * secret happened to be stored:
 *
 *     if (secrets?.whatsapp_app_secret) { ...verify, else 401... }
 *
 * With no secret configured that check was skipped entirely and the payload was
 * processed. Production has no `whatsapp_app_secret` set, so the endpoint was
 * accepting unsigned POSTs: anyone who knew the URL and a tenant id could inject
 * inbound "messages" into that tenant's inbox, which the app turns into contacts,
 * conversations and lead activity.
 *
 * The Razorpay webhook already got this right — no secret means no request can
 * ever be trusted, so it refuses. This brings WhatsApp to the same rule and puts
 * the decision somewhere it can be proved rather than read.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED IS NOT A PREFERENCE HERE. An unverified webhook is not "less
 * secure", it is unauthenticated remote write access. Refusing costs a
 * configuration step; allowing costs whatever an attacker chooses to send.
