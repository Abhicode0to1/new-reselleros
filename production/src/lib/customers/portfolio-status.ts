/**
 * What a customer IS, on the customers list — R-005 (Pardeep, 25 Sep 2026).
 *
 * ─── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The list read subscriptions and nothing else. So Excel Technologies — an active
 * ₹10,80,000 ERP build, `project_sales.customer_id` correctly set — showed as
 * **"No subscription", Monthly ₹0, Yearly ₹0**, and fell under the "No subscription"
 * filter beside genuinely dead accounts.
 *
 * Nothing was broken in the usual sense. The customer 360 page already showed the
 * project; only the list, which is where anybody looks first, said the account was
 * empty. A reseller who sells custom software as well as seats reads that as churn.
 *
 * ─── WHY "QUOTED" IS NOT THE SAME AS "CLIENT" ───────────────────────────────
 * The request says "an active / quoted project". They are split here, because a
 * quotation is not a customer relationship — calling somebody a project client on the
 * strength of a document they have not accepted is the same overstatement as counting
 * a quote as revenue. A quoted-only customer reads "Project quoted", which is true and
 * is also the more useful thing to see: it is a deal to chase.
 *
 * ─── MONEY STAYS OUT OF MRR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This decides a LABEL. A project's contract value must never be folded into Monthly
 * or Yearly revenue — those are recurring figures and a one-off build is not recurring.
 * It gets its own number on the strip.
