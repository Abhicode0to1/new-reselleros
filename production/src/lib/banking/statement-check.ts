/**
 * Does the account's computed "Balance in bank" agree with what the bank statement
 * itself says — and if not, why?
 *
 * Every imported line carries the bank's running balance (balance_after). The app's
 * figure is opening_balance + Σ(credit − debit). The two disagree for exactly two
 * reasons, and this names both, with amounts:
 *   1. the opening balance is not the balance before the first imported line;
 *   2. lines are missing between two dates — the running balance jumps by more than
 *      the lines in between explain.
 *
 * ─── ORDER WITHIN A DAY IS NOT TRUSTED ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Lines of one day may be stored in any order. Each day is re-threaded by the chain
 * itself (a line follows the one whose balance it starts from), so four salaries paid
 * on one date never read as a gap. Only day totals are compared across days, and a
 * gap is reported between two dates — never pinned to a line it cannot be sure of.
