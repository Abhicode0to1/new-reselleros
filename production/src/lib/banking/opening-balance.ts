/**
 * Opening balance, read off a bank statement's own running-balance column.
 *
 * The balance on a date D is the balance just BEFORE the first line dated on/after D:
 *   that line's balance_after − its credit + its debit.
 *
 * ─── IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * No balance column, or no line on/after D → null with a reason. A made-up opening
 * balance would silently shift every balance the account ever shows.
 *
 * ─── IT SAYS WHAT IT IS NOT SURE OF ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *  • `firstLineDate` later than D: the figure is the balance at the start of the
 *    statement. It equals the balance on D only if nothing moved in between — the
 *    statement cannot tell us, so the caller must say so.
 *  • `chainBreaks`: lines whose running balance does not follow from the previous line
 *    (±1 for rounding to whole rupees). A statement that does not add up is not one to
 *    take an opening balance from without looking.
