/**
 * Every internal link points at a route that exists.
 *
 * ─── THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The quote hub offered "Edit" on a draft and "Change the pricing" in the approval block,
 * both linking to `/quotes/<id>/edit`. That route has never existed. Fetched on 21 Aug
 * 2026: HTTP 404, "This page could not be found". Two visible buttons on a money screen,
 * both dead ends.
 *
 * Next.js would have caught it. `next.config` sets `experimental.typedRoutes`, so an
 * unknown route is a build error — and both call sites carried `as any` on the href, which
 * silenced exactly the check that was right. That cast is why the build stayed green.
 *
 * So the check is rebuilt here, where a cast cannot reach it: read the links out of the
 * source as text and resolve them against APP_ROUTES, the table route-map.test.ts already
 * proves matches `src/app` on disk.
 *
 * ─── DELIBERATELY PERMISSIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A dynamic segment matches anything, and an interpolated segment is allowed to match a
 * static one — `/quotes/${x}` may legitimately resolve to `/quotes/new` at runtime. This
 * misses some broken links. That trade is on purpose: a false positive here sends someone
 * to "fix" a working screen or gets the test deleted, and twice today a source-scanning
 * rule has fired on prose rather than code. A rule that only ever fires on real breakage
 * is worth more than a thorough one nobody trusts.
