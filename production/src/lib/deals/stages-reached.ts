/**
 * Which pipeline steps did this deal REALLY go through? Drives the ✓ on the deal page stepper.
 *
 * 1 Oct 2026, Pardeep, on Excel Technologies: first "jo kaam is deal me hue hi nahi unhe tick ke
 * saath kyo dikha raha hai" (it showed ✓ Demo Done and ✓ Trial Active because those come before
 * Won in the list), then, once the ticks were gone, "kya is deal ko quote nahi gaya — mere khayal
 * se gaya hai" (it had: an accepted project quotation). So a ✓ needs evidence, never position:
 *
 *   quote — a subscription quote that left draft, a project quotation past draft, or a recorded
 *           move into Quote Sent
 *   demo  — a recorded move into Demo Done
 *   trial — a recorded move into Trial Active, or the lead's trial_started_at
 *
 * The current stage is not "reached" here — the stepper highlights it on its own.
