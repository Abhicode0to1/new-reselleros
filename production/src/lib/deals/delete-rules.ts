/**
 * May this deal (a `leads` row) be deleted — and if not, what to do instead (2 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Pardeep: "kya deal delete hone ka koi system nahi hai". Deleting was open to every rep,
 * from the drawer only, and on a deal with a quote it failed with a raw foreign-key error.
 *
 *  - Only an owner or a manager deletes. A rep marks a deal Lost (with a reason), which
 *    keeps the history and the win/loss numbers honest. The database enforces this too
 *    (policy leads_delete_owner_manager), this is the words for it.
 *  - A deal with a quote is never deleted: the quote (and any invoice or payment behind it)
 *    is part of the books, and quotes.lead_id keeps it. Mark it Lost instead.
