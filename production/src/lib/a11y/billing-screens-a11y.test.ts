/**
 * R-022 (1 Oct 2026): the billing screens (customers, quotes, invoices, payments, projects,
 * items, subscriptions…) had 67 inputs a screen reader could not name, 18 labels not tied
 * to their box, and one hand-made popup without a focus trap. All fixed; this keeps them at
 * zero. Uses the same counter as `node scripts/a11y-count.mjs` (a heuristic over source).
 * Small text (text-2xs/3xs) is R-087's job, not counted here.
