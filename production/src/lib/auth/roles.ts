/**
 * Roles and what each one is allowed to do — the single source of truth.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before it there were TWO `UserRole` unions that disagreed: `types.ts` said
 * owner|sales|accountant|support, `nav.ts` said eight different values. Nothing
 * imported the `types.ts` one, so the disagreement was invisible — but a second
 * definition of "who is allowed here" is the kind of thing that gets imported by
 * accident later, and then two guards on the same route reach opposite answers.
 * Both now re-export from here.
 *
 * ─── ROUTES vs PERMISSIONS ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ───────────────────────────
 * `nav.ts` answers "which PAGES can this role open" and middleware enforces it.
 * This file answers "what can this role DO once it is on a page it may open" —
 * export a CSV, read an unmasked phone number, reveal a vault secret. Route
 * access does not imply data access: `delivery` can open the vault page and must
 * still only ever see masked values.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `customer_admin` is NOT a UserRole. The customer portal under (public)/portal
 * carries its own session keyed on `customerId` and never reads `users.role`; a
 * portal user has no row in `users` at all. Adding it here would invent a role
 * that nothing sets and imply internal-app access that does not exist. See
 * EXTERNAL_ACTORS below for the map.
 *
 * ─── THIS IS NOT THE LAST LINE OF DEFENCE ────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything here is app-layer. A flag that is false hides a button and refuses
 * an API call, and that is worth having — but the row-level guarantee is RLS in
 * Postgres. When a flag here protects tenant data, there must be a policy that
 * says the same thing. A check that only exists in TypeScript is a check that
 * stops at the first `curl`.
 */

/**
 * Every role that can appear in `users.role`.
 *
 * `accountant` and `support` are retained deliberately. They predate the current
 * matrix and real rows may still carry them; dropping them from the union would
 * make `ROLE_HOME[role]` undefined for those people and bounce them between a
 * redirect and a guard until they gave up. They are removed by migrating the
 * rows first, not by deleting a string.
