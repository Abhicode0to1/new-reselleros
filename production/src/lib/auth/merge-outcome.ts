/**
 * What the operator is told after `merge_stranded_user_into_tenant()` runs.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This lived inline in the Claim & Merge card's `onSuccess`. It is the one place
 * where a database outcome becomes a sentence an owner reads and believes, and it
 * has four cases that are easy to blur — in particular "moved" (their old
 * workspace was deleted) versus "attached" (there was no old workspace at all).
 * Telling someone a workspace was removed when none existed is a small lie that
 * costs a support conversation; telling them nothing was removed when one WAS is
 * worse. Pure and separate, so both can be asserted.
 *
 * The RPC's own error text is deliberately NOT translated anywhere: those messages
 * carry the reason and the next step (CLAUDE.md §24) and are surfaced verbatim.
