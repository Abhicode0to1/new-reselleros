/**
 * Domain → tenant matching, for ANUTECH DIGITAL PVT LTD.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THESE TESTS CAN AND CANNOT PROVE ───────────────────────────────────
 * The mapping from a domain to a tenant is DATA (`tenant_domains` rows, migration
 * 0242), not code. So these tests prove the ALGORITHM: given a set of claims, who
 * gets routed where, and — more importantly — who does not.
 *
 * They do NOT prove which domains ANUTECH DIGITAL owns in production. As of
 * 14 Aug 2026 that is exactly one verified claim, `anutech.in`. The fixtures below
 * that give it `anutechbilling.in` and `exceltechnologies.in` are a scenario, not a
 * statement about the live database. Making them true in production is two INSERTs
 * plus verification, not a code change — which is the point of putting ownership in
 * a table.
