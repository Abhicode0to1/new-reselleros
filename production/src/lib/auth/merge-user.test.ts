/**
 * Claim & Merge — the client-side contract around
 * `merge_stranded_user_into_tenant()` (migration 0243).
 *
 * ─── READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS FILE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Vitest CANNOT prove a Postgres SECURITY DEFINER function. There is no database
 * in this suite — it runs 1100+ tests in about four seconds precisely because
 * nothing here touches one. A test here that "verified accidental tenant deletion"
 * would be verifying a mock of my own writing, which is worse than no test: it
 * would go green while the real function deleted the wrong row.
 *
 * The deletion and migration behaviour is proved where it can be — against a real
 * database, on seeded fixtures, inside transactions that roll back:
 *
 *     supabase/tests/merge_stranded_user.test.sql
 *
 * ⚠️ Those SQL tests are NOT in CI and NOT in the Stop hook (CLAUDE.md §25.2), so
 * a DB change means running them by hand or it is not verified.
 *
 * What IS provable here, and is: the sentence an owner reads afterwards. That
 * sentence is the only account most people will ever get of what happened to a
 * colleague's account, and its four cases are easy to blur.
