 * imported `node:crypto` and a client component pulled `PIN_LENGTH` out of it, which turned the
 * whole `/vault/personal` route into a 500 (`UnhandledSchemeError`) while typecheck, lint and
 * the test suite all stayed green. Same split as `pin-rules.ts`: rules here, secrets elsewhere.
 *
 * Supabase enforces its own minimum (6 by default) and returns its own message. These rules sit
 * in FRONT of that so the operator is told before submitting rather than after — and so
 * "password too short" is not the first thing they learn about a link that may have expired.
