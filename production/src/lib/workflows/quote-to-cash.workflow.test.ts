/**
 * Workflow tests — the six operational journeys, composed from the REAL modules.
 *
 * ─── WHY THESE ARE VITEST AND NOT SIX MORE PLAYWRIGHT SPECS ─────────────────
 * The Playwright suite exists and is well written, but 70 of its 78 auth-gated tests
 * `test.skip` because there is no `.env.test`, and lighting them up needs a
 * SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY plus seeded fixture tenants. Adding six more specs would
 * add six more tests that never run — coverage that looks like a safety net and
 * catches nothing. `e2e/README.md` documents exactly what is still missing.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THESE CATCH THAT UNIT TESTS DO NOT ────────────────────────────────
 * Every module here is already tested on its own. What no per-module test can see is
 * the SEAM: whether the number one module produces is the number the next one
 * expects. Those are the bugs that survive a green suite —
 *
 *   • a quote priced by volume band, then approved against a different total
 *   • a seat request previewed at one figure and charged at another
 *   • a co-termed add-on whose aligned date does not match the schedule built from it
 *   • dunning that fires on an invoice the payment path already settled
 *
 * Each test below walks one journey end to end through the same functions the
 * application calls, in the same order, and asserts the handoffs.
