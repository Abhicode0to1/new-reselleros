/**
 * Filling a lawyer's agreement template with facts — and never writing a clause.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS MODULE WILL NOT DO, AND WHY IT IS NOT SQUEAMISHNESS ──────────
 * The brief asks the AI to "automatically Service Level Agreement (SLA) & Master Services
 * Agreement (MSA) PDF generate kare". Generating the DOCUMENT is built here. Generating its
 * CLAUSES is not, and the reason is arithmetic rather than caution.
 *
 * An MSA fixes liability, indemnity, termination, IP ownership, data-protection duties and
 * jurisdiction. An SLA fixes availability and what it costs us when availability is missed.
 * Those are not descriptions of a deal, they are the deal's downside — and a model-written
 * clause is a binding obligation nobody read.
 *
 * MEASURED, on this tenant's real catalogue and a 30-seat Business Starter deal:
 *
 *   customer pays ......................... Rs 8,100 / month  (30 x Rs 270)
 *   our margin ............................ Rs 4,800 / month  (30 x Rs 160)
 *   a 99.0-99.9% month at 15% credit ...... Rs 1,215  =  25% of that margin
 *   a 95-99% month at 25% credit .......... Rs 2,025  =  42% of that margin
 *   a sub-95% month at 50% credit ......... Rs 4,050  =  84% of that margin
 *
 * That is Google's own service-credit schedule, applied to OUR invoice. One bad month upstream
 * takes most of a month's margin — for downtime we neither cause nor control. And there is no
 * recourse behind it: TASKS.md:1564 records the Google reseller agreement as NOT APPROVED, so
 * today we could owe credits with nothing to claim back. An uptime commitment is a promise about
 * somebody else's datacentre, underwritten by a reseller's margin.
 *
 * So: the legal text is a FILE A LAWYER SUPPLIES. This module fills the blanks in it with facts
 * the application already holds, refuses to render when any fact is missing, and proves it added
 * nothing — see `verifyOnlySlotsChanged`. That is the same discipline every money path in this
 * repo follows: figures come from the catalogue, prose comes from a human, and the app does the
 * joining.
 *
 * ─── AND A HALF-FILLED CONTRACT IS WORSE THAN NO CONTRACT ───────────────────
 * A signed agreement still reading "{{CUSTOMER_GSTIN}}" is a document whose terms are arguable
 * and whose party is unidentified. `fillTemplate` fails closed on any unresolved slot rather
 * than shipping a blank, because a quotation with a gap gets corrected and a contract with a gap
 * gets litigated.

 *    provider; having heard of it is not the same as having an agreement with it.
 *
 * 3. A SIGNATURE IS IRREVERSIBLE AND OUTWARD-FACING. Once a customer has signed, the obligations

 *    activation — waits for a person, and this is the most binding of the three.

 * block where the operator is standing (CLAUDE.md §24), instead of a disabled button.
