/**
 * Minting the hand-off token that signs a user into DMS.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS TOKEN IS ALLOWED TO SAY ───────────────────────────────────────
 * An email address, and nothing else that matters. Not a role, not a
 * permission, not a tenant. DMS looks the email up in its OWN user collection
 * and decides what that person may do there.
 *
 * That asymmetry is deliberate and worth keeping: an "owner" here is not an
 * admin there, the two permission models will drift, and a token that could
 * assert a role would turn this shared secret into a privilege-escalation
 * primitive against the other application.
 *
 * ─── SHORT, SINGLE-USE, AND ITS OWN SECRET ───────────────────────────────────
 * The token travels in a URL, so it will land in browser history and proxy
 * logs. It lasts 60 seconds, carries a random `jti` that DMS burns on first
 * use, and is signed with DMS_SSO_SECRET — separate from anything Supabase
 * uses, because this one is shared with a second application and is therefore
 * the most likely of our secrets to leak.
 *
 * ─── FAIL CLOSED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No secret configured means no link is offered. It must never fall back to an
 * unsigned or default-signed token.

 * parsing lives — algorithm confusion, `alg: none`, segment handling — and DMS
 * does that with the real library. SIGNING is the easy direction. We control
 * every input, there is nothing to parse, and the whole operation is one HMAC.
 * A dependency added to a 90-package app to avoid ten lines of crypto is not a
