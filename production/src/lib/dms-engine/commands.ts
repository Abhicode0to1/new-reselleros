/**
 * Sending a command to the DMS engine — the WRITE half of the integration.
 *
 * The read client (`client.ts`) holds a key that can only read. This one holds
 * `DMS_ENGINE_COMMAND_KEY`, which maps to DMS's `BILLING_COMMAND_API_KEY` and can
 * spend money (it can register a domain), so it lives in its own module with
 * one caller per command, never imported by anything that merely displays data.
 *
 * The engine's contract (DMS app/api/integrations/engine/commands):
 *   - `commandId` is the idempotency key. The SAME id replays the stored result
 *     and never runs again; a different id asks for new work.
 *   - a lost response is `needs_reconciliation`: the work may have happened, the
 *     subject is locked, and it must NOT be sent again under a new id.
 *
 * `classifyCommandResponse` turns the engine's answer into the few outcomes a
 * caller acts on. It is pure so every branch is tested.
