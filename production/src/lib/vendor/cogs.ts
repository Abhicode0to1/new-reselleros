/**
 * What a subscription actually COSTS us, and how sure we are.
 *
 * ─── THIS REPLACES `mrr × 0.83` ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The subscriptions list computed cost as `Math.round(s.mrr * 0.83)` under a comment
 * reading "Heuristic: ~17% margin on typical reseller subs". Every subscription in
 * the app therefore showed a 17% margin — not because it earned 17%, but because the
 * number was defined to be 17%. It sorted, it coloured a badge, it fed a KPI tile,
 * and it was a constant wearing a measurement's clothes.
 *
 * That was the fifth copy of that guess found in this codebase. The others were in
 * the quote builder (×0.7), the quotes list (×0.83), the add-subscription dialog
 * (×0.83) and the invoices page (×0.17).
 *
 * ─── THREE SOURCES, IN ORDER OF TRUTH ───────────────────────────────────────
 *   vendor    what the vendor actually billed us (subscriptions.vendor_cost_*).
 *             The only figure that is a fact rather than an expectation.
 *   catalog   items.wholesale via subscriptions.item_id — the agreed price list.
 *             Right almost always; wrong exactly when a promo ends or an account
 *             falls out of a volume band, which is the case worth catching.
 *   unknown   no catalogue row and no vendor bill. Reported as unknown, never as a
 *             number, because a made-up cost produces a made-up margin and a rep
 *             discounts against it.
