/**
 * useUrlChoice — a page's tab / view held in the URL, so a link can open it (R-118).
 *
 * Every KPI tile in the app shows a number about a set of records. Until 2 Oct 2026 no list
 * page took its tab or view from the URL, so a tile could only open the page — never the set
 * it counted — and the owner had to find the same filter by hand. This hook is the one place
 * a list page says "my tab may come from ?tab=", and the tiles link to that.
 *
 * Read from `window` after mount, not `useSearchParams()`: that hook opts a page out of
 * prerendering unless it sits under a Suspense boundary, and `npm run build` fails on it
 * (the same trap customers/page.tsx documents). After mount, not in the initialiser: the
 * server render has no URL, so an initialiser would render one tab on the server and another
 * on the client — a hydration mismatch. The cost is one frame on the default tab.
 *
 * Writing back uses history.replaceState — no navigation, no refetch, no scroll jump — so the
 * address bar always says what the screen shows and a refresh or a shared link reopens it.
