/**
 * useNavBadges — fetches live counts for sidebar badges.
 *
 * Returns a map of nav item id → badge string (or undefined if zero).
 * Only shows a badge when count > 0 so the sidebar stays clean.
 *
 * ─── ONE CALL, NOT TEN (S16, 28 Sep 2026) ───────────────────────────────────
 * This used to run auth.getUser + a users read + seven parallel COUNTs + one approvals
 * COUNT — about ten requests per open tab every 60 seconds, and the getUser/users pair
 * duplicated what useCurrentUser had already fetched for the same page. Now:
 *
 *   - who is asking comes from useCurrentUser (cached, shared with Sidebar/TopBar);
 *   - every count comes from ONE rpc, nav_badges() (migration 20260928130000), which is
 *     SECURITY INVOKER — it counts exactly the rows the caller's RLS shows, the same as
 *     the PostgREST counts it replaces. The filters there mirror the ones that were here,
 *     and supabase/tests/nav_badges.test.sql holds the two to each other.
 *
 * Badge ↔ page consistency (CRITICAL, Pardeep dogfood 2026-05-29): a badge must mirror
 * what the destination page renders, otherwise "Leads 14" opens an empty page. That is
 * why leads (stage new/contact — the pre-quote inbox) and deals (quote/demo/trial) are
 * separate buckets, and why the SQL was written as a line-for-line copy of these filters.
 *
 * ─── Quotes waiting on YOUR approval ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The only count addressed to a person rather than to the tenant. Which tiers this role
 * may clear still comes from the shared `tiersApprovableBy`, passed in as p_approval_tiers,
 * so the badge, the /quotes filter and `awaitsMyApproval` cannot drift. The SQL adds the
 * other two parts: pending, and not raised by me (auth.uid(); a NULL requester is
 * dropped, as PostgREST's `neq` did). No tiers → no approvals badge.
