/**
 * Turning a WhatsApp send failure into the right HTTP answer.
 *
 * ─── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `/api/whatsapp/send` mapped **every** throw to `502` in one catch-all. So on
 * 12 Aug 2026 a workspace that simply had not filled in its WhatsApp credentials
 * produced this, in Cloud Run's ERROR bucket:
 *
 *     502  [/api/whatsapp/send] failed: WhatsApp credentials are not configured
 *          for this workspace. Settings → Integrations → WhatsApp Business.
 *
 * Two things wrong with that, and the first is the expensive one:
 *
 * 1. **It is not a server error, so it must not be logged as one.** Production had
 *    four 5xx events in the fortnight to 22 Aug; this was one of them. A settings
 *    page nobody filled in was sitting in the same bucket as a lost backup,
 *    diluting the only signal anybody scans. An error log that carries
 *    configuration notices stops being read as errors.
 * 2. **502 means "try again, the upstream is unwell".** Nothing here will change on
 *    a retry — Meta was never called. The client cannot fix a 502; it can fix a
 *    409, and the message already says exactly where to go (CLAUDE.md §24).
 *
 * A genuine Meta or network failure is **still a 502**. That is the whole point:
 * classify, do not lump. Same shape as `lib/backup/sweep-retry.ts` and
 * `lib/email/gmail-transport.ts`.
