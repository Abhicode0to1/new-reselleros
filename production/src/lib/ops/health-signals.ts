/**
 * Whether the scheduled work actually happened, answered from the database.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Asked on 23 Aug 2026: "jo mene error handling ke liye automation ka kaam karwaya tha
 * kya wo sahi kaam kar raha hai." Measured, the answer was: two of its three eyes are
 * shut.
 *
 *   Cloud Run logs   the primary source — gcloud auth expired mid-session
 *   Sentry           us din SENTRY_DSN khaali tha. ⚠️ 1 Sep 2026 ko naapa:
 *                    ab DONO DSN Cloud Run par SET hain (95 chars) — ye
 *                    itihaas hai, aaj ki haalat nahi. Delivery ki tasdeeq
 *                    dashboard se hi ho sakti hai.
 *   DB log tables    working — and the only thing that found anything all day
 *
 * So a scan that reported "System healthy" was reporting on what it could still see,
 * which is precisely the failure AGENTS.md L1 is about: a failure that looks like a
 * success. Worse, the day's real defects were reported by the operator or found by
 * reading code, not by the scan.
 *
 * This module reads the signals the database CAN answer, so the check no longer depends
 * on a token that expires. It is pure — the caller does the queries and hands the counts
 * in — so every rule below is testable without a database.
 *
 * ─── AND IT REFUSES TO SAY "HEALTHY" WHEN IT CANNOT SEE ─────────────────────
 * `sourcesUnavailable` is not decoration. A checker that answers "healthy" while blind
 * is worse than one that errors, because the answer is indistinguishable from the real
 * thing. Anything unavailable downgrades the verdict to `unknown`, which reads as
 * "nobody knows" rather than "nothing is wrong".

   *
   * ─── ALL THREE CONDITIONS, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE I MISSED ──────────────
   * The first version of this check counted "inside the 30-day window with
   * reminder_count = 0" and raised an ALARM on today's data. It was wrong. The one
   * subscription it found was created 22 Aug for a 27 Aug renewal — five days apart —
   * and the ladder opens at T-15, which for that row was 12 Aug, before it existed.
   * Today is T-4, and T-4 is not a step (the ladder is T-30/15/12/9/6/3/0).
   *
   * So the cron was working and the check was crying wolf on its second query of the
   * day. `renewal_email_log` being empty means "no subscription has yet reached a ladder
   * step", which in a workspace this young is the correct and quiet answer.
   *
   * L38 says absence of evidence needs both halves. It needed three: never reminded, a
   * step has passed, AND the row existed when it passed.
