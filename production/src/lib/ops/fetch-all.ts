/**
 * Read EVERY row of a PostgREST query — past the 1000-row cap (WC-scale, 30 Sep 2026).
 *
 * WHY: PostgREST answers at most `max_rows` rows (supabase/config.toml: 1000) and says
 * nothing when it cut the answer short. A cron that reads "all active subscriptions" in one
 * select silently snapshots the first 1000; a report that counts leads in the browser counts
 * the newest 1000. Nothing errors — the number is just wrong, and it gets more wrong as the
 * business grows. The same service-role client is capped too: max_rows is a server setting,
 * not a role grant.
 *
 * Two helpers, no Supabase import (so they are unit-tested with a fake page function):
 *   - fetchAllRows(page)        — pages `.range(from, to)` until a short page comes back;
 *   - fetchAllRowsIn(ids, page) — the same, for an `.in()` id list, IN_CHUNK ids a request
 *                                 (a URL with 5,000 uuids is ~190 KB and gets refused by
 *                                 the proxy long before PostgREST sees it).
 *
 * THE QUERY MUST HAVE A TOTAL ORDER. Offset pages over an order with ties (created_at alone)
 * can repeat or skip a row across a page boundary. End the order on a unique column — `id`.
