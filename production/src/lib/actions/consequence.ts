/**
 * What an irreversible action is about to do, in the operator's words.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS SHARED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three acts in this app cannot be taken back: issuing a tax invoice, sending a quote
 * to a customer, and recording a payment. Each has its own reasons, but two things are
 * identical across all three and were about to be written three times:
 *
 *   - the document-number format, `{PREFIX}-{DOC_CODE}-{YYYY}-{YY}-{NNNN}`, matching
 *     live rows like `INV-TEST-2026-27-0008`;
 *   - the series-gap check, which turns out to matter everywhere. Measured 23 Aug 2026,
 *     ANUTECH holds **zero** invoices with its invoice series at 32, **zero** payments
 *     with its receipt-voucher series at 39, and a quote series at 41. Every counter has
 *     holes, so every one of these dialogs should say so.
 *
 * A fourth act — suspending or cancelling a subscription — is NOT here, because it does
 * not exist as an operator action. The nearest thing, deleting a subscription, already
 * confirms properly (`subscriptions/page.tsx`: what it does, what it is for, and the
 * alternative when it is blocked). Naming a tap that has no button would have been
 * inventing work.

 *
 * R-015 (29 Sep 2026) shortened it from 21 characters to 16. CGST Rule 46(b) allows 16

 * its END year only — FY2627 → "27" — which is unambiguous and monotonic.

 * The tenant code stays, deliberately: `invoices.id` is a bare global primary key, so
 * without it the second tenant to issue its first invoice of a year collides with the
 * first tenant's. Capped at 4, as the SQL caps it.
