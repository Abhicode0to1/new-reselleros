/**
 * Inbound-email status helpers — pure, UI-agnostic so they're unit-testable
 * without pulling the Supabase client (see deletable.ts for the same pattern).
 *
 * The webhook writes one of these `status` values to inbound_emails:
 *   received | lead_created | appended_to_lead | duplicate |
 *   skipped_non_enquiry | error | ignored | reply_sent
 *
 * ⚠️ The last two were MISSING from that list until 30 Aug 2026, and missing from the
 * switch below with them. Counted against the live table that day:
 *
 *     appended_to_lead 8 · skipped_non_enquiry 8 · reply_sent 6 · lead_created 6 · ignored 4
 *
 * — and `received`, `duplicate` and `error`, the three this file did document, had zero
 * rows between them. So the vocabulary here described statuses nothing writes while
 * omitting ten rows' worth of statuses that everything writes.
 *
 * The visible cost was the `default:` arm, which renders `status` verbatim. Four bounce
 * notices sat in the live Inbox wearing a badge that said **"ignored"** — a database
 * word, lowercase, shown to a salesperson. That is the exact thing this page's own
 * header says it removed when it renamed the folders away from `untriaged` /
 * `appended` / `skipped`; it had simply survived one layer down.
