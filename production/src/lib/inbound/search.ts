/**
 * The Gmail-style search box: `from:sujay is:unread label:workspace seats`.
 *
 * Pure, so the parser can be tested without a mailbox — and so the page never has to
 * grow its own copy of "what does is:unread mean".
 *
 * ─── AN OPERATOR WE DO NOT SUPPORT IS REPORTED, NEVER IGNORED ───────────────
 * This is the whole reason the parser returns `unknown` instead of dropping what it
 * cannot read. A search box that silently ignores `is:important` returns EVERY email
 * and looks like it filtered — the rep reads the first twenty results believing they
 * are the important ones. Ignoring a filter is worse than refusing it, because the
 * result is indistinguishable from a filter that matched a lot.
 *
 * The caller shows `unknown` back to the rep. Nothing here decides how.
 *
 * ─── WHAT `label:` MEANS HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `route` — the only label-shaped column inbound_emails has. There is no vendor or
 * tag column, so `label:google` matches a row routed as "google" and nothing else.
 * It is not a guess at the vendor from the subject line; a search that quietly
 * pattern-matched the body would return mail that merely MENTIONS Google.
