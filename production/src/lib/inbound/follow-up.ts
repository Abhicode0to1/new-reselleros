/**
 * Does this inbound email deserve a follow-up task?
 *
 * The inbound webhook already asks Gemini `{ isEnquiry, company, contactName,
 * phone, product, summary }` and writes one of `lead_created`,
 * `appended_to_lead` or `skipped_non_enquiry`. That judgement works — measured
 * against the 9 real rows in production, a Google "Security alert" from
 * no-reply@accounts.google.com is correctly skipped while a genuine
 * "Need Microsoft 365 for 25 users" becomes a lead.
 *
 * What was missing is the task. This decides whether to create one, when it is
 * due, and how urgent — and it is a separate, pure function rather than more
 * prompt text for two reasons.
 *
 * ─── 1. THE AI MUST NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE A TASK FOR AN AUTO-REPLY ───────────
 * `extractWithGemini` returns null on ANY failure — timeout, quota, malformed
 * JSON — and the webhook then defaults to `isEnquiry: true`, deliberately, so a
 * real enquiry is never silently dropped. That default is right for lead
 * creation and wrong for task creation: on a bad Gemini day it would put an
 * "Out of office" bounce and every Google security alert on someone's task list,
 * and a task list that fills with rubbish stops being read at all.
 *
 * So the hard suppressions below run FIRST and cannot be overridden by the model.
 * The AI decides how interesting a real email is; it does not get to decide that
 * a delivery-failure notice is a sales conversation.
 *
 * ─── 2. AI OUTPUT CANNOT BE REGRESSION-TESTED ────────────────────────────────
 * "Gemini said yes" is not something a test can assert next month. The rules
 * here can be, and they are the part that decides whether a person's day gets
 * interrupted.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* SUPPRESSED ───────────────────────────────────
 * Email from the tenant's own domain. It looks like an obvious self-send to
 * ignore, but the real data shows `sales@anutech.in` and
 * `pardeep@exceltechnologies.in` arriving as senders and correctly producing
 * leads — staff forward customer enquiries in. Suppressing own-domain would have
 * broken a path that works today.
