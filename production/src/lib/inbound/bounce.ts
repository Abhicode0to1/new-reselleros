/**
 * A bounce is not an enquiry — it is news that OUR email did not arrive.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Found 30 Aug 2026 on the live Enquiries screen: four "Delivery Status Notification
 * (Failure)" messages sitting at the top of the Inbox, under a page whose own subtitle
 * reads "what you still owe an answer on". They carried the badge **"ignored"** — the
 * raw database word, rendered because `inboundStatusMeta` had no case for it — and the
 * app offered a **"Send quote"** button, pointed at mailer-daemon@googlemail.com.
 *
 * The signal was exactly inverted. A bounce means a quote we sent never reached the
 * customer; ANUTECH's four all name `darshan@anutech.in`, an address that does not
 * exist, while the customer's real address is at exceltechnologies. Someone was waiting
 * for a quote that had already failed to arrive, and the screen said "ignored".
 *
 * ─── WHY NOT REUSE `follow-up.ts`'S LIST ────────────────────────────────────
 * `AUTO_SUBJECTS` there is deliberately WIDER: it also holds "out of office" and
 * "automatic reply", because for deciding whether to raise a follow-up task, an OOO and
 * a bounce are the same answer — nobody is waiting. Here they are opposites. An
 * out-of-office means the mail ARRIVED and a human will read it on Monday. Reusing that
 * list would label every holiday auto-reply as a delivery failure, and a warning that
 * cries wolf is worse than no warning.
 *
 * ─── AND WHY NOT KEY OFF `status = 'ignored'` ───────────────────────────────
 * `routing.ts` writes `ignored` for ANY machine sender — a Google security alert from
 * no-reply@accounts.google.com lands there too. That is genuinely nothing to act on.
 * A bounce is something to act on. Same status, different news.

/**
 * Which address refused the mail, if the notice names one.
 *
 * ─── NULL RATHER THAN A GUESS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A bounce body contains several addresses — the failed recipient, the sender, the
 * reporting mail server, and often a support URL. Picking "the first email-shaped
 * thing" would frequently name OUR OWN address as the one that failed, which sends a
 * rep to correct a record that is already right.
 *
 * So only the phrasings that explicitly say WHO it failed for are matched. When none
 * of them appear this returns null, and the UI says the address is not named — the
 * same rule the extraction panel already follows for a field it could not read.
