/**
 * Read one inbound mail into the facts a quote needs: catalogue, seats, product, term.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT TWO COPIES ──────────────────────────────
 * Because it was two copies, and both of this week's quote failures lived in the gap
 * between them.
 *
 * The webhook has two branches — a mail from a stranger CREATES a lead, a mail from somebody
 * already in conversation APPENDS to theirs — and each one read the mail its own way. Every
 * new capability then had to be connected twice, by hand, and the reply branch is the one
 * that kept being missed:
 *
 *   23 Aug 2026  the entire auto-quote block existed on the create branch alone. A reply
 *                naming "50 Google Workspace Business Starter users on annual billing"
 *                corrected the lead and priced nothing.
 *   31 Aug 2026  the AI product matcher — added the day before, for exactly the wording
 *                "google workspace starter" — was on the create branch alone. A reply
 *                asking for 48 of them got a priced answer, a promise of a quotation, and
 *                no quotation.
 *
 * Neither was a wrong decision. Both were a step wired to one door out of two. So the
 * reading happens here, once, and `auto-quote-wiring.test.ts` counts the call sites.
 *
 * ─── WHAT STAYS WITH THE CALLER ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `stripQuoted`, deliberately. A reply carries our own previous message underneath it,
 * containing the very numbers being corrected — so the reply branch must read the stripped
 * text and NOTHING else, while the create branch falls back to the raw body when stripping
 * leaves nothing (a forwarded enquiry is often entirely quoted). Those two answers are
 * genuinely different and a boolean here would only hide that. The caller strips; this
 * function is told what to read.
