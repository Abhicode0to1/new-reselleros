/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Reported 22 Aug 2026 from the lead drawer, with a screenshot.

   The thread was:
     us       → "your enquiry for 50 users of Google Workspace Business Starter"
     customer → "Actually, I need the quotation for 20 users of Business
                 Standard, not 50 users of Starter. Please adjust that."

   And the "Quote is on the way" pill filled the composer with:

     "Thank you for your enquiry for 50 users of Google Workspace Business
      Starter. I am preparing the quotation now and will send it across shortly.
      If the number of users changes before then, just reply here and I will
      adjust it."

   It restated the exact figures the customer had just corrected, and then invited
   them to do the thing they had already done. Not a wrong template — a template
   fed a stale snapshot. `PillContext.seats`/`.product` come from the LEAD row,
   which records the FIRST enquiry; the newest inbound message is newer
   information and nothing told the pill it existed.

   This module already holds the principle it needed: the phone pill is hidden
   when a number is on file, because (its words) "a button that asks a customer
   for something already on file makes the reseller look like they did not read
   the email." Restating superseded seats is the same failure.

   The fix is NOT to guess the new numbers — this module never guesses (see
   `whatTheyAskedFor`, "or nothing, never a guess"). It is to stop asserting facts
   that may have been overtaken.
