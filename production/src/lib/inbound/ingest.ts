/**
 * Inbound email → Lead. The work, with no door on it.
 *
 * Inbound-email → Lead pipeline. A forwarded product-enquiry email lands here
 * (via an inbound-parse provider — Cloudflare Email Routing / Postmark /
 * SendGrid / Mailgun — that the operator forwards Gmail enquiries to), and we:
 *
 *   1. Verify the shared secret (INBOUND_EMAIL_SECRET) — fail closed.
 *   2. Normalise provider payload → { fromEmail, fromName, subject, text, messageId }.
 *   3. Claim the messageId in `inbound_emails` (UNIQUE) → idempotent (no dup leads).
 *   4. Gemini extracts { isEnquiry, company, contactName, phone, product, summary }
 *      (stub fallback when GEMINI_API_KEY is absent).
 *   5. A reply from somebody who already has an OPEN lead is filed on that
 *      conversation and is NEVER classified — the classifier is for strangers.
 *      Only when nobody matches: enquiry → create a Lead, non-enquiry → Spam /
 *      System. That ORDER is load-bearing; see lib/inbound/disposition.ts for the
 *      bug it fixes.
 *   5b. PHASE 1 — a reply that CHANGES what the customer wants (seats, product) is
 *      written into the lead, with the customer's own sentence recorded as the reason.
 *      Deterministic, not a model: lib/inbound/extract.ts. The quoted thread is
 *      stripped first, because a reply carries our previous message — and the numbers
 *      being corrected — underneath it.
 *   6. Notify the reseller owner (best-effort email).
 *
 * Public route — the secret is the only guard (mirrors the Razorpay webhook's
 * fail-closed posture). Uses the admin client (no session). v1 routes leads to
 * the single buy-page tenant; multi-tenant maps the ingest address → tenant later.

 * Everything this endpoint does once it believes the caller — normalise, route, classify,

 *
 * ─── WHY IT IS A FUNCTION AND NOT JUST THE REST OF `POST` ───────────────────
 * 30 Aug 2026: the app started reading `sales@anutech.in` directly through the Gmail
 * connector (`/api/cron/gmail-inbox`), because the Apps Script forwarder in front of this
 * webhook had failed silently — a stale copy posting an old `?key=` secret, 401 on every
 * run, and no enquiry reaching the app for two days.
 *
 * That gave this logic a SECOND caller, and there were only two ways to do it. Copying six
 * hundred lines was never one of them; the same argument `lib/ai/read-bill.ts` makes about
 * a copied prompt applies harder here, because these branches create leads and tasks.
 *
 * The other rejected option was to have the cron POST to its own public URL with the
 * secret. That works — it is exactly what the Apps Script did — but it authenticates the
 * process to itself over the network to reach a function it already has in memory, and the
 * failure it would then be able to report is one that cannot happen.
 *
 * So: `POST` owns the door (the secret, the JSON), and this owns the work. The webhook is
 * still the only thing exposed to the internet, and it is unchanged.

  /* ── EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE A LEAD ROW EXISTS ───────────────────────────
     Timeline entry, follow-up task, quote, AI reply — in that order, for both branches.
     It was written twice, and the two copies drifted every time something was added:

       23 Aug 2026  the quote block existed on the create branch alone. A reply naming
                    "50 Business Starter on annual billing" corrected the lead and priced
                    nothing.
       31 Aug 2026  the AI product matcher, added the day before for exactly the wording
                    "google workspace starter", was on the create branch alone. `readEnquiryFacts`
                    closed that half; this closes the other.

     Twice the repair was "call it on both branches too", and twice a test was added to count
     the call sites. That is a guard against forgetting, and forgetting was never the real
     problem — having two places to remember was. One list of steps means the next capability
     is added once and reaches both doors by construction.

     The "Reply from X" / "Email from X" timeline line is NOT here, deliberately. It belongs
     beside its own branch's lead write — the append branch files the mail before rewriting
     the lead, the create branch after inserting it — and moving it in here would push it
     BELOW the correction rows it explains ("Seats: (blank) -> 48, from the customer's reply").
     A one-line insert next to the write it describes is not the kind of step that drifts.

     A CLOSURE rather than a module: it reads tenantId, fromEmail, subject, text, rawHeaders,
     ai, extracted, senderIsOurs and selfTest straight from this request's scope. Lifting it
     out would mean threading nine unchanging values through a signature, which is its own way

  /* SEATS AND THE CATALOGUE PRODUCT, read here for the first time on this path.
     Traced 23 Aug 2026: `extracted` on this branch is the GEMINI result (`ExtractedLead`),
     and that shape has no `seats` field at all — so a new email lead has always been saved
     without a seat count, however plainly the mail stated one. The regex extractor that
     DOES read seats (`extractEntities`) was only ever run on the append branch below, for
     the Phase 1 correction write-back.

     That was the real break behind "50 Business Starter ka quote email par aa jayega?" —
     not the wording of the mail. Running it here costs one query and no AI call, and it is
     deterministic, which the model's answer is not.

     `stripQuoted` first, for the same reason the append path does it: a reply carries our
     own earlier numbers underneath, and reading THOSE would quote yesterday's figure. */

     forwarded enquiry is often quoted in its entirety, and stripping it would leave nothing
