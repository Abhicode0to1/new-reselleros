/**
 * Work out WHICH catalogue product a mail is asking about — exact match first, model second.
 *
 * ─── THE MAIL THAT MADE THIS A SHARED FUNCTION ──────────────────────────────
 * 31 Aug 2026, a real reply into `sales@anutech.in`:
 *
 *     "mujhe 48 email id google workspace starter ke liye qutoe chahiye monthly par"
 *
 * Seats, product and term — all three, in one sentence. The app filed the lead, wrote back a
 * priced answer naming "Google Workspace Business Starter" at Rs 325/seat/month, told the
 * customer *"I will prepare the quotation and share it with you"* — and drafted nothing. The
 * timeline says why:
 *
 *     "No new quote from this reply — the reply does not give both a seat count and a
 *      catalogue product, so there is nothing to price"
 *
 * The catalogue row is "Google Workspace Business Starter"; the customer wrote
 * "google workspace starter". `findProduct` wants the whole name, so it missed — which is
 * EXACTLY the case the AI fallback was added for on 30 Aug.
 *
 * That fallback was wired into the branch that CREATES a lead and not into the branch that
 * appends a REPLY. Same shape as the 23 Aug bug, where the entire quote block lived on the
 * create branch alone: a reply from somebody already in conversation, naming seats and a
 * plan, is the most quote-worthy mail this app receives, and it is the branch that kept
 * being forgotten.
 *
 * So the capability is a function now, and `auto-quote-wiring.test.ts` counts both call
 * sites. A branch is a place to forget something; a function is not.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The model CHOOSES from the catalogue, it does not describe. Its answer is accepted only
 * when it matches a row's name exactly, and the price always comes from that row — see
 * `lib/quotes/product-match-ai.ts`. A miss returns null, which is what the caller did before
 * this existed, so nothing gets worse when the model is unavailable or unsure.
