 * R-025, second half — a route must not hand Postgres's own words to the browser.
 *
 * The line is not "hide database errors". `raise exception` inside one of this project's
 * SECURITY DEFINER guards arrives as P0001 and its wording IS the next step the operator
 * needs (§24). Hiding those would replace every money guard with "something went wrong",
 * which is exactly the dead end §24 forbids. So the test pins BOTH sides.
