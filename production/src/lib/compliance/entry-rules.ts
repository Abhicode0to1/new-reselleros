/**
 * Indian law checks for an entry before it is saved (2 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Pardeep: "ai data entry agent ko india ke accounts, business law aur india ke law ki
 * acchi samajh honi chahiye — agar entry law ke hisaab se nahi ho rahi to warning deni
 * chahiye".
 *
 * These are RULES IN CODE, each with its section, not the model's opinion: a language
 * model asked about tax law is fluent and sometimes wrong, and a confident wrong warning
 * (or a missing right one) on a money entry is worse than none. Every rule here is tested.
 * The model may add its own notes; the UI shows those separately as "AI note — check with
 * your CA".
 *
 * Severity:
 *  - "stop": the entry as written breaks a provision with a penalty or a disallowance
 *            (cash ≥ ₹2 lakh received, GST heads that cannot both apply). Saving needs an
 *            explicit "I understand" from the operator.
 *  - "check": something to act on (deduct TDS, claim ITC in time, fix a total).
 *
 * Thresholds are those in force for FY 2025-26 onwards (Finance Act 2025). They are kept in
 * one table so a future Budget is a one-line change — and the table says when it was set.
