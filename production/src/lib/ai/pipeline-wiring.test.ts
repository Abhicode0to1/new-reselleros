/**
 * The pipeline's wiring, asserted on the SOURCE of sales-agent.server.ts.
 *
 * Two of the four things this file protects are ORDERINGS, and an ordering cannot be tested
 * through the public API without a live Gemini key: run the stages in the wrong order and every
 * function still returns a valid-looking value, just built from the wrong inputs. So this reads
 * the file, the way `telecall-chokepoint.test.ts` does for the same reason.
 *
 * A source test is a blunt instrument and it earns its place here because the failure it catches
 * is silent. If stage 1 runs AFTER the responder's prompt is assembled, the briefing is simply
 * absent from it — no error, no type failure, a slightly worse reply, and the second Gemini call
 * still billed for every message. Nothing else in the suite would notice.
