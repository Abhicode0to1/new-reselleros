/**
 * Carry out what the support agent decided: answer and resolve, ask for more, or fetch a person.
 *
 * ─── THE DIAL COVERS WHATSAPP TOO, AND THAT NEEDED WRITING BY HAND ──────────
 * `sendEmail` is the chokepoint for mail: pass `automated` and it resolves the autonomy dial,
 * logs the outcome, and refuses if the kill switch is on (lib/email/send.ts). WhatsApp has no
 * such chokepoint — `sendWhatsApp` posts straight to Meta. An agent that respected the brake on
 * email and ignored it on WhatsApp would be a brake in name only, and the kill switch is the
 * control somebody reaches for when a wrong instruction has already gone out. So the WhatsApp
 * path resolves the dial and writes the log here, in the same shape send.ts uses and the same
 * shape `quote-dispatcher.ts` uses.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not decide anything. Whether this answer may be sent unattended was decided by
 * `applyEscalationRules` in support-agent.ts, and re-deciding here would mean two places that
 * could disagree about the same draft. This file writes the outcome to the ticket and moves the
 * message.
 *
 * It also does not invent a ticket. The caller opens the ticket before the agent runs, because a
 * support request that is captured but unanswered is recoverable and one that was never recorded
 * is not.
 *
 * ─── THE ESCALATION ALERT IS NOT GATED, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE ──────────────
 * The customer-facing answer goes through the dial. The mail that says "this ticket needs
 * somebody" goes to OUR OWN desk and is ungated — see the comment beside `support.reply.send` in
 * lib/ai/autonomy.ts. A kill switch that also silenced the escalation alarm would turn one busy
 * morning into a customer discovering we never answered.
