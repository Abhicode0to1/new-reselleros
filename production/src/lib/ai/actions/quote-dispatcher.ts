/**
 * Carry out what the sales agent decided: reply, quote, or fetch a human.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not create quotes. `lib/quotes/auto-quote-for-lead.ts` already does that, and it
 * does the three things that are easy to get wrong: it allocates the id through the
 * `next_document_number` RPC with retries (CLAUDE.md §17a — the sole allocator, because the
 * GST series under CGST Rule 46 must be gapless and a number invented in JS breaks it), it
 * prices from the catalogue through `planQuoteFromEnquiry`, and it refuses to send on five
 * separate conditions each of which reaches the operator as a sentence.
 *
 * Writing a second quote-creation path here would have meant two versions of money
 * arithmetic to keep in step — the exact mistake `auto-quote-for-lead.ts`'s own header
 * describes being moved out of the webhook to avoid. So this file decides WHETHER, and that
 * file decides HOW MUCH.
 *
 * ─── THE DIAL COVERS WHATSAPP TOO, AND THAT NEEDED WRITING BY HAND ──────────
 * `sendEmail` is the chokepoint for mail: pass `automated` and it resolves the autonomy dial,
 * logs the outcome, and refuses if the kill switch is on (lib/email/send.ts). WhatsApp has no
 * such chokepoint — `sendWhatsApp` posts straight to Meta. An agent that respected the brake
 * on email and ignored it on WhatsApp would be a brake in name only, and the kill switch is
 * the control somebody reaches for when a wrong price has already gone out. So the WhatsApp
 * path resolves the dial and writes the log here, in the same shape send.ts uses.

         The real reason was that the agent has no monthly rate and refused to invent one.
         Debugging that cost an hour, and the log had pointed away from it the whole time.

         So: the model's own `handover_reason` first, and when it did not give one, a sentence

           was shown is the annual-commitment figure, so "annual" is never an assumption.

           It missed the case that actually happened. 30 Aug 2026: the app asked "monthly
           or annual?", the customer answered **"monthly"**, and the reply that went out
           quoted "Rs 325 per seat per MONTH" — while the document attached to it,
           Q-ADPL-2026-27-0045, was raised for Rs 1,11,255 a YEAR. The words and the
           document disagreed, and the document is the half a customer keeps.

         billing term, the GST split, the supplier's GSTIN and the terms — it says everything
         a "here is your quotation" note would say, and it arrives with the document.
