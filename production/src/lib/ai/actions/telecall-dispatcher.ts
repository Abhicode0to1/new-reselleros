/**
 * The one door every outbound AI call goes through.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `sendEmail` is the chokepoint for mail: pass `automated` and it resolves the dial, logs the
 * outcome and refuses when the kill switch is on. Voice has no such chokepoint — `placeCall`
 * posts straight to Retell or Vapi, exactly as `sendWhatsApp` posts straight to Meta. An agent
 * that respected the brake on email and ignored it on the phone would be a brake in name only,
 * and the kill switch is what somebody reaches for when a wrong price has already gone out.
 *
 * So the dial is resolved HERE, before the vendor is asked, in the same shape
 * `quote-dispatcher.ts` uses for WhatsApp — and `telecall-chokepoint.test.ts` pins that
 * ordering on the source, because "does this call site resolve the dial first" reads in the
 * source and not at all in a mock.
 *
 * ─── WHAT `hold` MEANS HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not "do nothing". The number is resolved, the catalogue is read, the script and the dynamic
 * variables are built in full, and all of it is written to `ai_telecall_logs` with status
 * `held`. The operator opens that row, reads exactly what would have been said and to whom,
 * and rings by hand. The feature is useful at hold, which is what stops anybody moving the
 * dial merely to get value out of it — the same bargain `support.reply.send` made.
