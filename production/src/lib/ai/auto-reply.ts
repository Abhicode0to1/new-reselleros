/**
 * May the app answer this customer by itself?
 *
 * Step 2 of the agent plan. The DECISION only — the drafting and the sending live elsewhere,
 * so this can be argued about against a table instead of against a mail server.
 *
 * ─── SEVEN THINGS HAVE TO BE TRUE, AND SIX OF THEM FAIL QUIETLY ─────────────
 * The one that would be caught in testing is "the draft promises something". The other six
 * are the ones that produce a bad outcome while looking like success:
 *
 *   - replying to ourselves (a loop, and the worst failure here)
 *   - replying when THEY are not waiting — answering our own last message
 *   - replying twice to the same message
 *   - replying to a thread a human is already handling
 *   - sending an empty or truncated draft
 *   - sending when the drafter fell back to a template it did not write for this lead
 *
 * Each returns a sentence, because every refusal lands on the lead's timeline and on
 * /automation, where somebody has to decide what to do about it.
 *
 * ─── WHY "NOT ALREADY REPLIED" IS ITS OWN INPUT ─────────────────────────────
 * The inbound webhook is idempotent on `messageId`, so the same mail cannot be processed
 * twice — but that is the WEBHOOK's guarantee, not this decision's. A retry from a different
 * angle, a manual replay, or a second automated path added later would each reach here with
 * a message already answered. Two replies to one email is not a small error: the customer
 * gets two different sentences from the same company and has to ask which one counts.

   * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED ON A LIVE MESSAGE (24 Aug 2026) ──────────────
   * `findPromises` runs its money check with an EMPTY allow-list, because on the path it was
   * written for — an acknowledgement — no figure is authorised at all. That is right there and
   * wrong for a SALES reply, whose entire job is to name a price.
   *
   * Measured, not reasoned: the first real enquiry the AI sales agent ever answered was held
   * here with `the draft commits us to something — it says "Rs 864" (and 2 more)`. Rs 864 is
   * the tenant's own catalogue price, read from `items.msrp` at call time; the "2 more" were
   * the 3.5% card-loading figure and the round-the-clock support line. Every one of them is a
   * thing the agent's own prompt authorises.
   *
   * The consequence was worse than a held reply. This gate sits UPSTREAM of the dial: when it
   * refuses, `run-sales-agent.ts` files the draft and returns without ever reaching the
   * dispatcher. So moving `reply.send` to `auto` would have changed nothing — no priced reply
   * could ever be sent, at any setting, and the feature's main path was closed while looking
   * open.
   *
   * ─── WHY IT IS SAFE FOR THE SALES PATH AND NOWHERE ELSE ─────────────────────
   * `applyHandoverRules` (lib/ai/sales-agent.ts) has already, by the time this is reached:
   *   · run `verifyDraftMoney` against the CATALOGUE figures on BOTH customer-visible surfaces
   *     — a stricter check than this one, because it knows which figures are real
   *   · refused any date, discount or guarantee, minus the two phrases the prompt authorises
   *   · overruled the model to HANDOVER_TO_HUMAN on any failure, so a failing draft never
   *     arrives here at all
   * A caller that passes this flag WITHOUT such a check has switched the rule off. There is a
   * test asserting `run-auto-reply.ts` — the acknowledgement path, which must keep promising
   * nothing — does not pass it.
