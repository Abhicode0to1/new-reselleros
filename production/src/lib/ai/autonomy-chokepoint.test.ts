/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Is the brake actually connected?

   The dial and the log are pure and well tested, and that proves nothing about whether any
   send goes through them. This file is the part that would catch the real failure: a
   registry full of actions, a kill switch that resolves correctly, and five crons that
   never ask.

   A source scan, because the thing being checked is WIRING. Rendering these routes would
   need Supabase, Resend and Cloud Scheduler stubbed, and would still not answer the
   question — "does this call site pass `automated`" reads directly in the source and not at
   all in a mock.

   `send.ts` states the cost of the opt-in design out loud: "a new automated caller that
   forgets this is ungated. The test in autonomy-chokepoint.test.ts scans for that." This is
   that test, and the comment is a promise it has to keep.
