/**
 * One inbound support message, end to end: find its ticket, remember it, understand it, act.
 *
 * This is what the support webhooks call. It is the support-side twin of `run-sales-agent.ts`
 * and follows the same order for the same reasons.
 *
 * ─── ORDER OF OPERATIONS, AND WHY ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. Find or open the ticket. Everything else hangs off a ticket id — the transcript's
 *    composite FK, the SLA clocks, the escalation flag — and a support request that is captured
 *    but unanswered is recoverable while one that was never recorded is not.
 * 2. Record the customer's turn. If anything below fails, their words are still in the
 *    transcript and the next reply has them as context.
 * 3. Clear the "waiting on the customer" clock. They wrote — so the 48-hour auto-close must not
 *    fire under their reply, and clearing it here means the row is corrected before the cron can
 *    ever see it.
 * 4. Read who they are and what they bought, run the agent, apply the hard rules.
 * 5. Dispatch: answer, ask, or escalate.
 *
 * ─── WHY A REPLY REOPENS A RESOLVED TICKET INSTEAD OF OPENING A NEW ONE ─────
 * The agent tells the customer, in the resolution note and implicitly by resolving, that
 * replying continues the conversation. If a reply opened a second ticket, the thread the rep
 * needs would be split across two rows with the history on the closed one — and the customer
 * would be answered by somebody reading half of it. So a reply inside the auto-close window
 * reopens. Outside it, a new problem gets a new ticket, which is what a fortnight-later "hello
 * again" actually is.
