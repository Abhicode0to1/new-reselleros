/**
 * How much the app is allowed to do on a customer's behalf without a person present.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT PROMPTED IT ───────────────────
 * Asked on 23 Aug 2026: "can an AI sales agent do a real salesperson's job?" The audit that
 * followed found something more urgent than the answer. **There is no way to stop this app
 * emailing customers from inside this app.** Five crons — invoice dunning, renewals, trial
 * expiry, compliance reminders, birthday greetings — send unattended today, and the only
 * way to stop any of them is to disable a Cloud Scheduler job in a Google console. Grepped
 * for `ai_enabled`, `emails_paused`, `sending_paused`, `DISABLE_EMAIL`: nothing.
 *
 * So this is not scaffolding for a future agent. It is the brake the current app is missing,
 * and it is worth having before anything else is automated.
 *
 * ─── THE MODES, AND WHY THREE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   auto  — do it, nobody is watching
 *   hold  — prepare it and wait for a person. NOT the same as off: the work is done, the
 *           draft exists, and the operator's next action is one tap rather than a blank page
 *   off   — do not do it at all
 *
 * "hold" is the mode that makes a dial useful instead of binary. Every AI route in this repo
 * today is effectively `hold` — 13 of them draft and none of them send — and that has been
 * fine. The dial exists so moving one of them to `auto` is a decision somebody makes, in one
 * place, reversibly.
 *
 * ─── THE DEFAULTS ARE "WHAT THE APP DOES TODAY", DELIBERATELY ────────────────
 * The obvious design — default everything to `hold` and let config opt in — would have
 * SILENTLY STOPPED five working crons the moment this was wired, because no tenant has any
 * config yet. Dunning would quietly stop chasing money. So each action declares the mode
 * that is live right now, and that declaration is the fallback. Introducing the brake must
 * not itself change behaviour; that is a separate, visible decision.
 *
 * A new action added later declares its own default, and the review question for the author
 * is exactly the right one: is this safe to do while nobody is looking?

       `hold`, not `auto`, and this is the whole shape of the rollout. The machinery works:
       the drafter runs, `decideAutoReply` checks seven conditions, and `findPromises` refuses
       anything naming a price, a date, a discount or a guarantee. What is missing is not code
       — it is Pardeep having watched it. So it prepares the reply, files the draft on the
       lead's timeline where he already looks, logs the decision, and sends nothing. He moves
       this to `auto` from /automation when he believes it.

       exactly as `reply.send`'s did the day before.

       `hold`, not `auto`, and for a sharper reason than the reply path. A reply answers
       somebody who just wrote to you; a nudge writes to somebody who chose not to answer. If
       the agent misjudges the moment, a reply looks clumsy and a nudge looks like pestering —

       `hold`, and this is the one to watch longest of the three. A sales reply that misreads
       the customer loses a deal; a SUPPORT reply that misreads the customer is a set of
       instructions somebody follows, in their own DNS zone or their own admin console. The
       guards are real — no record value the tenant has not verified, no credential request, no
       price, and an outage backstop that overrules the model's own severity — but none of them
       is Pardeep having read twenty of these first. He moves this to `auto` from /automation

       a sandbox and then tell them it worked.

       At `hold` the link is CREATED and filed on the quote's timeline, so the operator copies

       CCA, against a contract, with UIDAI authentication of the signer. No such provider is
       configured for any tenant here.

       It also stays off after one is. A signature is the most binding thing this application
       could ever cause: the moment it lands, the obligations exist, and nobody can un-sign it.
       Every other irreversible action here — a payment link, a provisioning activation — waits
       for a person, and `decideSignatureRequest` refuses at ANY dial setting unless somebody has
       read the specific rendered document. That check is deliberately not a config, for the same

       step 4 calls it "a preview of the 5–7 day application" — an application that has not been
       made. `off` is what this file's header asks for: the mode that is live right now.

       And even once it exists, `decideProvisioning` will refuse to activate against a test-mode
       payment at ANY dial setting. That gate is deliberately not a config: the dial answers
       "may we act unattended", and the test-key check answers "is there anything real to act
       on". Turning this to `auto` today would mean giving seats away to anybody who reaches a

       lib/ai/telecaller-prompt.ts, lib/telecall/provider.ts and the two /api/v1/telecalling
       routes — so the action exists now and has to be declarable.

       `hold`, and of everything in this registry it is the one to leave there longest. Each
       action above sends TEXT: an email or a WhatsApp message, which the customer reads at
       their own moment, which can be followed by a correction sitting next to the original,
       and which exists as a draft a person can read before it goes. A phone call has none of
       those properties. It interrupts, it cannot be edited, it cannot be recalled, and the
       first draft a human ever sees is a transcript of something the customer already heard.

       So `hold` here means something specific and useful rather than "off with extra steps":
       the app resolves the number, reads the catalogue, builds the whole script and the
       dynamic variables, writes the row to `ai_telecall_logs` with status `held` — and dials
       nothing. The operator opens that row, sees exactly what would have been said and to
       whom, and rings by hand in the meantime. That is the same bargain `support.reply.send`
       made: useful at hold, so nobody is tempted to move the dial just to get the value.

       There is a second reason, and it is not ours to overrule. An unsolicited commercial
       call in India is the CALLER's regulatory problem, not the telephony vendor's. Moving
       this to `auto` is a decision about the company's exposure, and it belongs to Pardeep at
       /automation rather than to whoever merges this. */

       What makes it worth a dial at all is the other direction: the email is
