/**
 * The AI sales agent's reasoning layer — prompt in, validated decision out.
 *
 * Everything here is PURE. No Gemini call, no database, no clock: the prompt is built from
 * arguments and the model's answer is validated against a schema. `sales-agent.server.ts`
 * does the fetching and the calling. That split is not tidiness — it is the only way the
 * decisions below (what the agent is allowed to say, when it must fetch a human) can be
 * tested without a network, and they are the decisions that reach a customer.
 *
 * ─── PRICES ARE PASSED IN, NEVER WRITTEN DOWN HERE ──────────────────────────
 * The obvious shape for a sales agent is a product table at the top of the file. It was
 * deliberately not built that way, and this is the most important line in the module.
 *
 * `items.msrp` in the tenant's own catalog is the single source of truth for what a customer
 * pays (lib/pricing/workspace.ts says so, and the public checkout and the auto-quote both
 * read it so "Buy now" and "Get a quote" cannot disagree). A price constant in this file
 * would be a SECOND source, and a second source of a rupee figure does not stay equal to the
 * first — it goes stale silently and the agent quotes yesterday's price with today's
 * confidence.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The spec this was built from named Workspace Standard at ₹750;
 * the live catalog says **₹864 per seat per MONTH** (wholesale ₹620/month), measured 24 Aug
 * 2026. A hardcoded ₹750 would have under-quoted every Standard deal with nothing to catch it
 * — .github/workflows/money-check.yml exists because four products once shipped with defaults
 * BELOW their own vendor cost. So the catalog is read at call time and handed in as
 * `catalog`, and `allowedMoney` carries exactly those figures to the money guard.
 *
 * ─── AND READING IT AT CALL TIME WAS NOT ENOUGH ─────────────────────────────
 * This header used to describe ₹864 as a per-YEAR figure, and `loadSalesCatalog` copied the
 * column across on that belief. Reading the live value protects you from a stale number; it
 * does nothing about a wrong UNIT. Twelve times wrong, on every price, below our own cost —
 * see MONTHS_PER_YEAR for what it looked like in a real draft. The lesson the first half of
 * this comment was missing: name the unit next to the number, every time.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THE MODEL IS AND IS NOT TRUSTED WITH ──────────────────────────────
 * Trusted: reading intent, reading sentiment, choosing words, deciding that a quote is what
 * this customer now wants.
 * Not trusted: arithmetic, document numbers, and its own confidence. Quote totals come from
 * the catalog and lib/pricing; the quote number comes from the `next_document_number` RPC;
 * and `applyHandoverRules` can overrule the model's chosen action but can never relax it —
 * see the function.

 * and a machine that skips it loses money that was available." That was correct — while the
 * machine had no discount to give. It now has one: a published volume rate card
 * (lib/pricing/volume-slabs.ts) that says exactly what 21–50 and 51–100 seats earn. Applying
 * a published rate is not a negotiation, so the objection stops holding at 100, where the
 * card stops and the answer really does become "it depends on what the vendor will fund".
 *
 * The 50-seat line did not disappear, it changed job. It is now REVIEW_ABOVE_SEATS: 51–100
 * seats are priced and drafted in full, and held for a person rather than sent. So the band
 * that used to produce nothing now produces a finished quote, and still nobody's money moves

 * month) and `lib/quotes/quote-from-enquiry.ts` has always honoured it: its annual line rate

 * agent stated was a twelfth of the real one, which is to say far below our own cost.
 *
 * Measured 24 Aug 2026 on a demo run: the agent's covering email said "12 seats of Google
 * Workspace Standard at Rs 864 per seat per year" while the quote it referenced by number
 * said ₹1,500/seat/year and the truth was ₹10,368. One deal, three numbers, two of them
 * below cost — and `verifyDraftMoney` APPROVED it, because its allow-list was built from the
 * same wrong figures. A money guard checking against the wrong source is not a guard.
 *
 * The conversion is a named function rather than a bare `* 12` so a test can pin it against

     Nothing in this prompt asked for that — the model reached for it because it sounds
     like Indian B2B procedure. It is wrong twice.

     A quotation needs no GSTIN at all; it is not a tax document. And on the invoice it is
     not compulsory either: CGST Rule 46(b) asks for the recipient's GSTIN **where the
     recipient is registered**, and a supply to an unregistered person is a valid B2C tax
     invoice without one. Plenty of real buyers have no GST number.

     So the sentence turns a "yes, send the quote" into a form to fill in, and quietly tells
     a customer without a GSTIN that they may not be able to buy. The reminder belongs at the

       30 Aug 2026, live, 70 seats. The draft was correct and it was HELD:

         "For 70 seats, our published 5% reseller volume discount applies."      ← exempt
         "...Rs 3,078 per seat per year plus 18% GST after the discount."        ← HELD

       The promise guard masks a discount sentence only when THAT sentence names this deal's
       authorised percentage (`maskAuthorisedSellingPoints`). The first sentence carried "5%"
       and passed; the second said "the discount" with no figure, so the guard read it as a
       concession nobody approved and handed the whole reply to a human.

       The guard is right and must not be widened — an unnumbered discount promise is exactly
       what it exists to catch, and its own comments warn that loosening it is how a money
       guard dies. But it makes the reply a coin toss: the same authorised 5% sends or holds
       depending on whether the model happened to repeat the figure. The 100-seat reply an
       hour earlier said "5% ... discount band" in every mention and went out.

       So the rule moves here, where it costs nothing: carry the figure, or use another word.
       Same lesson as the block below — do not ask the model to remember, tell it what to
       write. */

       Measured on Q-ADPL-2026-27-0017: the email said "70 seats at Rs 3,240 per seat per
       year, plus 18% GST" — Rs 2,67,624 by the reader's own arithmetic — while the document
       totalled Rs 2,54,243, because the 5% band for 51–100 seats was applied to the quote and
       never mentioned in the words. Nothing was overcharged; the customer simply cannot
       reconcile the number, and 5% off list is a reason to buy that we were hiding.

       ─── FIRST ATTEMPT FAILED, AND THE REASON MATTERS ───
       On 26 Aug I first wrote this as an instruction: "when the table gives this seat count a
       discount, SAY SO". Deployed, verified live, and then Q-ADPL-2026-27-0018 went out for
       80 seats saying "Rs 3,240 per seat per year plus 18% GST" — the discount unmentioned
       again. The instruction asked the model to do three things: find the band for 80 seats,
       do the arithmetic, and remember to say it. Any one of them is a coin toss.

       So it is now a FACT, not an instruction — the app does the lookup and the arithmetic and
       hands over finished figures, exactly as `authorisedTotals` does for rupee totals. The
       model has nothing left to work out; it only has to repeat what it was given. Every
       money rule in this file that survived contact with a live message has this shape. */

 *
 * ─── MEASURED ON THE FIRST REAL MESSAGE THIS AGENT EVER SAW, 24 Aug 2026 ────
 * A probe enquiry went through the live webhook. The agent read it correctly — intent right,
 * confidence 0.95 — wrote a good reply, and then its own guard refused to send it:
 *
 *   reply.send / held — 'The draft commits us to something nobody authorised — it says
 *   "24/7"; "free". A promise in our name needs a person behind it.'
 *
 * Both of those are things `SALES_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` explicitly tells it it MAY say:
 * "24/7 support from a named local team" and "Free migration of existing mail and data".
 * So the prompt authorised two phrases and the guard refused them — meaning every reply that
 * used the company's actual selling points handed over, which is close to every first reply.
 * The machinery was alive and the feature was practically dead.
 *
 * Why `findPromises` fires: `24/7` matches its DATE branch `\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}` — it reads as
 * 24 July — and bare `free` matches its DISCOUNT branch, which is correct for "first month
 * free" and wrong here. Neither pattern is broken; they were written for the acknowledgement
 * path, where the safe reply promises NOTHING at all.
 *
 * ─── WHY MASK TWO PHRASES RATHER THAN DROP THE RULES ────────────────────────
 * Dropping `date` would let "we'll migrate everything by Friday" through, and dropping
 * `discount` would let "the first month is free" through. Those are the two the rule exists
 * for. So the exemption is exactly as wide as the prompt's own promise list and no wider:
 *
 *   · `24/7` (and 24x7) → always, because in a sales reply it never means a date
 *   · `free`            → ONLY inside a sentence that is also about migration
 *
 * The second condition is the important half. "Migration is free" is the authorised claim;
 * "the first month is free" in any other sentence is still caught, and there is a test
 * pinning that boundary. Same shape as `support-agent.ts`'s maskSupportIdioms, which exists
 * for the same reason on the support side.

  /* ── THIRD EXEMPTION: the rate card's own volume discount (26 Aug 2026) ─────
     The prompt now REQUIRES the reply to name the slab it applied, because a quotation whose
     arithmetic the reader cannot follow is one they have to query — measured on
     Q-ADPL-2026-27-0017, where the words said Rs 3,240 + 18% GST and the document totalled
     Rs 2,54,243 after an unmentioned 5%.
     Without this mask that instruction would hand over EVERY discounted quotation, exactly as
     "24/7" and "free migration" once did. The prompt authorising a phrase and the guard
     refusing it is the same dead-feature shape this function was written to fix.

     ⚠️ HOW NARROW, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE FEATURE:
     the sentence must name THIS deal's authorised percentage. So:

       "5% volume discount for 51–100 seats"  slab 5  → exempt
       "I can give you a discount"            no pct  → still holds
       "10% off for you"                      slab 5  → still holds
       "5% discount"                          slab 0  → still holds (nothing authorised)

     A discount the model invented, rounded up, or offered to win an argument is refused as
     before. Only the figure the APP itself computed and applied to the document is excused,
     which is the same principle as `allowedMoney`: the guard trusts a number the app derived,
     never one the model chose. */

    /* The lookbehind is the whole guard, and the test that demanded it is worth keeping in

       an authorised 5 would have excused a 5.5% concession the app never computed. Exactly
       the widening this file warns about elsewhere, found by its own test.

       anything with a fraction in it did not come from `slabFor`. */

     three lines up) and says "18% GST" (a statutory rate, not a concession). The agent would
     hand over 100% of the time and the feature would be dead on arrival — which is exactly
     the "guard that gets switched off within a week" that money-guard.ts warns about.
