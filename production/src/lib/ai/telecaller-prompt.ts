/**
 * What the voice agent is, what it may say, and what it is handed before it dials.
 *
 * Pure — no env, no database, no clock. Everything the persona needs arrives as arguments so
 * the prompt can be asserted in a test, which is the only way to notice that a rule quietly
 * stopped being in it.
 *
 * ─── THE PRICES ARE NOT IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE POINT ─────────────────
 * The brief listed them: "Google Workspace (Starter Rs 270/mo, Standard Rs 750/mo)". Two of
 * those three numbers are a problem, and both were measured against the live catalogue on
 * 25 Aug 2026 rather than argued about:
 *
 *   · Starter is Rs 270/seat/month — correct, today.
 *   · Standard is Rs 864 per seat per month, not Rs 750. Quoting 750 undersells it by Rs 114 a
 *     seat a month: on a 12-seat deal that is Rs 16,416 a year given away, spoken aloud, by a
 *     machine, with nobody in the room.
 *   · And the deeper failure is not the wrong figure — it is that a figure lives in a source
 *     file at all. `GW-STD-fbb` was Rs 750 at some point and is Rs 864 now. Whichever number
 *     were pasted here would be right on the day it was written and silently wrong afterwards,
 *     and no test can catch that because the file would agree with itself.
 *
 * This is not a new lesson in this codebase, it is the same one twice. On 24 Aug 2026 the
 * sales agent quoted a TWELFTH of every price because `loadSalesCatalog` copied a monthly
 * figure into a field named per-year — and `verifyDraftMoney` approved it, because its
 * allow-list came from the same wrong source. See sales-agent.ts's MONTHS_PER_YEAR comment.
 * `quote-builder.tsx` still holds a hardcoded plan→price map that disagrees with the
 * catalogue on 8 of 8 lines; it survives only because it is an unreachable fallback, and
 * TASKS.md lists removing it as outstanding work.
 *
 * So the catalogue is READ at call time and rendered into the prompt as an authorised fact.
 * The persona below describes the SHAPE of what may be said about price; the numbers come
 * from `items`, the same row the quote is built from.
 *
 * ─── AND IT MAY NOT DO ARITHMETIC ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The agent states a per-seat rate. It never states a total. That rule was learned on the
 * email side (`authorisedTotalsFor` — the app computes the total and hands it over as a fact)
 * and it binds harder here: an email total can be corrected in the next email, and a total
 * said on the phone is the number the customer writes down.
