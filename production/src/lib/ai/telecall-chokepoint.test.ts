   Is the brake connected to the phone?

   `autonomy-chokepoint.test.ts` scans every action whose name ends in `.send`, because until
   now every gateable action WAS a send. `telecall.place` is not one — it places a call — so
   that file's loop does not cover it, and an action the registry declares but nothing enforces
   is worse than no action at all: it reads as a control the operator does not have. This file
   is that coverage.

   A source scan, for the same reason the original states: the thing being checked is WIRING.
   "Does this call site resolve the dial before contacting the vendor" reads directly in the
   source and not at all in a mock.
