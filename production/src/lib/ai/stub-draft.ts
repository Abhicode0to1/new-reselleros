/**
 * The deterministic follow-up draft, used when Gemini is unavailable OR when the
 * money-guard discards an AI draft.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LOCAL FUNCTION ──────────────────────────
 * It was a private function inside `api/ai/draft-followup/route.ts`, which meant
 * nothing could test it — and its three EMAIL variants each ended:
 *
 *     \n\nThanks,\nExcel Technologies
 *
 * a hardcoded company name in text the operator sends to their own customer.
 * Excel Technologies is historical (CLAUDE.md §1), so on this tenant it is simply
 * the wrong company; on any other tenant it names a business the customer has no
 * relationship with. `lib/whatsapp.ts` had exactly this defect and fixed it — its
 * test still asserts no message says "Excel Technologies" — but the fix stopped at
 * WhatsApp. The three WhatsApp variants below carry no signature at all, which is
 * why they were never wrong and why the gap went unnoticed.
 *
 * The sign-off is a required parameter now. Not optional with a default: a default
 * is how the last one survived, and an unset signature must be a compile error
 * rather than a silent fallback to somebody's name.
 *
 * ─── MONEY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `outstanding` arrives in WHOLE RUPEES (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md §13) and is
 * formatted with `rupee()`. This function never computes a figure — it restates
 * one the caller read from the database, which is the whole reason the caller
 * falls back here when the model invents a number.
