/**
 * Why a deal was lost — and routing that answer to the right KIND of fix.
 *
 * ─── THIS IS THE SAFEST OF THE FOUR LEARNING LOOPS, FOR TWO REASONS ─────────
 * playbook.ts, reflection.ts and gold-standard.ts all had to refuse something. This one mostly
 * does not, and it is worth saying why rather than reaching for the same objection a fourth time.
 *
 * 1. LOST DEALS INVERT THE DANGEROUS SELECTION. A won-deal filter selects for what CLOSES deals,
 *    and the most persuasive thing to say is often the thing we cannot say — which is how a
 *    learning loop rediscovers "official Google Partner" and "2-hour migration". A lost-deal
 *    filter selects for what did NOT work, and there is no temptation to overclaim in "we were
 *    slow" or "they said the price was high".
 *
 * 2. RESPONSE DELAY IS A FACT ABOUT US. It comes off two timestamps. No customer text, no claim,
 *    no figure, nothing to redact — the cleanest signal in any of these four features.
 *
 * ─── BUT THE BRIEF'S OWN CONCLUSION DOES NOT FOLLOW ─────────────────────────
 * It asks two questions — "kya price zyada laga? kya response delay hua?" — and then prescribes
 * ONE answer to both: "GST Input Tax Credit Savings ko aur zyada emphasize karna shuru kar deta
 * hai."
 *
 * THOSE TWO DIAGNOSES HAVE OPPOSITE FIXES.
 *
 * Lost on PRICE, and leading with the tax credit is a reasonable response: the money genuinely
 * comes back, it is on our own invoice, and a buyer who has not counted it is comparing the wrong
 * number.
 *
 * Lost on DELAY, and emphasising the tax credit does nothing whatsoever. Nobody declined because
 * the pitch was under-argued; they declined because nothing arrived. The fix is operational —
 * open the dial, verify the sending domain — and changing the pitch instead does something worse
 * than nothing: it makes the numbers look like the pitch was the problem, so the next person to
 * read them goes and rewrites a prompt rather than turning on a setting.
 *
 * ─── AND TODAY EVERY LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO US IS A SILENCE LOSS ──────────────
 * Measured on the live tables:
 *
 *   quotes ............................ 31   (27 accepted, 3 draft, 1 sent)
 *   quotes LOST ....................... 0
 *   leads with lost_at set ............ 0
 *   lost_reason values ever recorded .. none
 *   agent turns ever written .......... 0
 *   held drafts on lead timelines ..... 12
 *
 * There are no lost deals to analyse — not few, zero. And response latency cannot be computed at
 * all, because the agent has never replied: twelve drafts were written and held. So if anything
 * is costing deals right now it is silence, and a loop that responded by emphasising the tax
 * credit harder would be treating a delivery failure with rhetoric.
 *
 * `diagnoseLoss` therefore returns a FIX KIND alongside the cause, and refuses a pitch change on
 * any cause that is not about the pitch. That routing is the feature.
 *
 * ─── ON AUTOMATING THE ADJUSTMENT: NOT NEVER, JUST NOT YET ──────────────────
 * The other three loops were refused automation on principle. This one should not be, and the
 * distinction is worth being precise about: adjusting which AUTHORISED claim we lead with cannot
 * introduce a claim, so its worst case is leading with the wrong TRUE thing, which costs a
 * suboptimal email. That is the safe axis lib/ai/tone.ts, trade-in.ts and ab-test.ts all use.
 *
 * What stops it today is the sample, not the principle — and `suggestEmphasis` says so in words
 * rather than refusing on grounds that would still hold at scale.
