/**
 * GST defects on an invoice that has already been issued.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS IS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every other GST helper here DECIDES something at the moment an invoice is raised.
 * This one goes back over what was decided and asks whether it can be justified. Those are
 * different jobs: the first has to produce an answer, the second is allowed to say "this
 * was a guess".
 *
 * It CHANGES NOTHING. It returns findings. A tax head cannot be corrected by editing an
 * issued invoice anyway — that needs a credit note (CGST s.34) — so an auto-fix here would
 * be both wrong and unlawful.
 *
 * ─── THE FINDING THAT MOTIVATED IT, MEASURED ON THE LIVE BOOKS 22 AUG 2026 ──
 * Nine customers have no state_code and no usable GSTIN, and all their invoices were
 * issued as intra-state — CGST + SGST, Delhi:
 *
 *   Jijo corprotion 2,78,916 · KAILASH 2,13,840 · Pankaj 1,65,600 · abc corporaton 1,13,676
 *   Pardeep Sharma 1,13,676 · POP TECH 81,000 · Excel Technologies 56,400
 *   Joel 32,400 · ROHINI TECH 32,400          = Rs 10,87,908 taxable
 *
 * Nobody chose that. `isInterStateSupply` returns FALSE when the buyer's state is unknown,
 * and false means intra-state — so "we do not know" and "same state as us" produce an
 * identical, confident invoice. If any of those customers sits outside Delhi, the invoice
 * carries the wrong head: the customer cannot claim the credit, and the seller owes IGST
 * with interest.
 *
 * That is why place_of_supply_unknown is CRITICAL rather than a warning. It is not a
 * missing field. It is a tax decision made by a default.
 *
 * ─── AND WHY THERE IS NO AI IN HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every check below is arithmetic or a comparison against a known list. A model would add
 * cost, latency and doubt to answers that are already certain — and on a GST notice,
 * "the model thought so" is not a defence.
