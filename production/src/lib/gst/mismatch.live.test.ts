/**
 * The detector run against the REAL invoices, as they stood on 22 Aug 2026.
 *
 * This is not a unit test of the rules — mismatch.test.ts does that. This is the answer to
 * "what does it actually find in our books", pinned so that a future change to the rules
 * cannot quietly stop finding it.
 *
 * The rows below were read out of production (21 invoices, ANUTECH tenant) and reduced to
 * the fields the audit reads. No amounts were altered; the customer names are the real ones
 * because the finding is about specific customers and anonymising them would make the
 * output impossible to act on.
