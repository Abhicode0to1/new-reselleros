/**
 * Is this lead already a customer?
 *
 * ─── THE BUG ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Pressing "Send Quote" on a lead opened the quote builder on the **Existing customer**
 * tab with an empty dropdown. Pardeep reported it as "existing customer selected nahi
 * aata", and the interesting part is that it was two different faults wearing one symptom:
 *
 *   • For a lead that IS already in the customer book, nothing looked it up. The operator
 *     had to find their own customer in a dropdown, on a page they reached FROM that
 *     customer's lead.
 *   • For a lead that is NOT a customer — "Demo1 Company", stage `contact`, and none of the
 *     four customers matches it — there was nothing to select at all. The form was sitting
 *     on a tab that could never be satisfied, and the operator's only correct move was to
 *     notice the other tab and switch to it.
 *
 * quote-builder.tsx:199 skipped its prospect-seeding entirely in lead mode
 * (`if (isLeadMode || customerId) return`), so the toggle stayed on its initial "existing"
 * and nothing ever moved it.
 *
 * ─── MATCH ON EMAIL FIRST, NAME SECOND ──────────────────────────────────────
 * An email address is a near-identifier: two businesses do not share one. A company NAME
 * is not — "Excel Technologies" is a lead here and also a customer, and this tenant's own
 * history (CLAUDE.md §4a) is a case of two records sharing a name and not being the same
 * organisation.
 *
 * So an email hit is trusted outright, and a name hit only when it is EXACT after
 * normalisation. No fuzzy matching: selecting the wrong customer silently addresses a
 * quote — and later an invoice — to someone else, which is worse than making the operator
 * pick.
