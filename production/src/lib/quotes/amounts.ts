 *
 * Renewal + extension quotes were storing the EX-GST subtotal in `amount`,

 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Migration `20260817100000_fix_missing_gst_on_onboarded_quotes` never ran, and one
 * quote is still carrying its consequence: `Q-2026-9776` (SAHAKAR INFRACON, accepted)
 * holds subtotal ₹45,360 at 18% with `amount` ₹45,360 — ₹8,165 of GST missing. Measured
 * 21 Aug 2026: across all 27 quotes in production it is the ONLY one off by more than a
 * rupee. So this check costs nothing on real work and catches exactly the broken row.
 *
 * The point is not to fix that quote. Whether ₹45,360 was meant to be GST-inclusive is a
 * commercial question, and answering it wrong either short-changes the company or
 * re-prices something a customer has already accepted. The point is that nobody should
 * be able to turn a self-inconsistent quote into a **tax invoice** by accident while
 * that question is open — an invoice is a GST document, and its numbers stop being
 * editable the moment it exists.
