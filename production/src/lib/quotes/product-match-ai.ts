/**
 * Which catalogue item did the customer mean — asked of the model, answered from the list.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE EXACT MATCHER WAS NOT ENOUGH ───────────────────────────────────
 * 30 Aug 2026, live. Pardeep wrote "mujhe 40 email ke liye quote chahiye **google workspace
 * starter**". The catalogue's own name is "Google Workspace **Business** Starter", so
 * `findProduct` — which requires the full catalogue name as a whole-word substring — matched
 * nothing, and the lead recorded:
 *
 *   "No quote drafted automatically — the mail did not name a product from this tenant's
 *    catalogue"
 *
 * One missing word. The tenant sells exactly one Google Workspace plan, so what the customer
 * meant was not in doubt to any human reading it. Pardeep's own question was the right one:
 * *"isme ai ka use kyo nahi karte, ye understanding to ai khud kar lega"*.
 *
 * ─── AND THE THING THAT SCARED US OFF WAS NOT THE MODEL ─────────────────────
 * The rule is strict because of a real quote that went out wrong: a customer wrote "Google
 * Workspace BUSINESS Standard", the longest-first substring loop fell through to an
 * eight-character hosting SKU literally called "Standard" (Rs 125/month), and the quotation
 * priced their Workspace seats at Rs 1,500/seat/year.
 *
 * That was a STRING-MATCHING accident, not a judgement error. Handing the same question to
 * something that can read is not a loosening of that guard; it is the part of the job the
 * guard was standing in for.
 *
 * ─── THE SHAPE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The model **chooses**, it never **describes**:
 *
 *   · it is shown the catalogue and may answer with one of those names, or null
 *   · anything that is not EXACTLY a catalogue name is thrown away and becomes null
 *   · the returned value is a catalogue ROW, and every rupee comes from that row
 *
 * So the worst a wrong answer can do is quote the wrong PRODUCT at that product's correct
 * price — which is the same failure a human typing the wrong line into the builder makes,
 * and it is visible on the document. It cannot invent a price, and it cannot invent a plan
 * that is not sold. This is the same pattern `read-bill.ts` uses for `expense_category`:
 * constrain the answer to a list, then trust only the list.
 *
 * ─── AND IT ONLY RUNS WHEN THE CHEAP PATH FAILED ────────────────────────────
 * `findProduct` still goes first: it is free, instant and certain. This is the fallback for
 * the case that used to end in silence, so the extra call is paid only where the alternative
 * was giving up.
