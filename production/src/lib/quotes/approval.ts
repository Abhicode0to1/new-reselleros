/**
 * Discount and margin approval — who has to say yes before this quote goes out.
 *
 * ─── THE MATRIX ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   Discount ≤ 10%          → nobody, send it
 *   Discount 11–20%         → a manager
 *   Discount > 20%          → the owner
 *   Margin   < 12%          → the owner
 *
 * The last two are not in the brief in that form and both are decisions, so they
 * are stated here rather than buried:
 *
 * • The brief defines 11–20% and stops. A matrix where a 15% discount needs a
 *   manager and a 40% discount needs nobody is not a matrix, so anything past the
 *   top band escalates rather than falling through. Silence in a rule table is the
 *   one place a default must be the STRICTEST option, not the loosest.
 *
 * • "Owner/Finance" maps to the owner alone. This tenant has `billing` and
 *   `accountant` roles, but they are bookkeeping roles — they raise invoices and
 *   read the P&L. Letting them clear a thin-margin deal would hand pricing
 *   authority to whoever does the invoicing. If a real finance approver ever
 *   exists, it is one line in OWNER_APPROVERS.
 *
 * ─── BOTH TESTS RUN; THE STRICTER ONE WINS ──────────────────────────────────
 * A quote at 15% discount AND 8% margin needs the OWNER, not a manager. Taking
 * the first rule that matched would let a rep pick the cheaper approver by
 * arranging the discount, which is the whole game an approval matrix exists to
 * stop.
 *
 * ─── NOBODY APPROVES THEIR OWN QUOTE ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not even an owner. This is not in the brief either, and it is the single hole
 * that makes every other rule decorative: a manager who can approve their own 20%
 * discount has no approval step at all, they have a checkbox. See `canApprove`.
 *
 * ─── AN APPROVAL IS FOR SPECIFIC NUMBERS, NOT FOR A QUOTE ───────────────────
 * Approving at 15% and then editing to 30% must not stay approved. `isStale`
 * compares what was approved against what the quote says now, and any move in the
 * customer's favour voids it. See `evaluateApproval`.
 *
 * Percentages are basis points throughout — 12% is 1200. Rounding a percentage to
 * an integer and comparing it to a threshold is how 10.4% becomes "10%, auto-
 * approved".
