/**
 * Converting a quote line's rate when its commitment changes.
 *
 * ─── THE UNIT CHANGES WITH THE COMMITMENT ───────────────────────────────────
 * `LineCommitment` has two families and they do not measure the same thing
 * (database.types.ts:1052):
 *
 *   monthly     — the flex tier, no commitment. The rate is **per seat per MONTH**.
 *   annual_*    — the annual price tier. The rate is **per seat per YEAR**.
 *
 * Three SQL regression tests pin that convention down. `monthly_subscription` asserts
 * "the line is Rs 38,232 PER MONTH"; `record_payment_billing_cycle_decouple` asserts
 * "expected 32400 (the whole month)"; `renewal_and_subscription_creation` asserts
 * "mrr should be 3900 (the full month)". `record_payment` relies on it —
 * `v_line_amount / case when v_is_monthly then 1.0 else 12.0 end` is CORRECT because a
 * monthly line's amount is already one month.
 *
 * ─── THE BUG THIS FIXES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `quote-builder.tsx`'s `updateCommitment` recomputed the rate from the catalogue's
 * price tier — and when the item had no tier, fell through to:
 *
 *     // No catalog link OR tier not found — just update commitment, keep current rate
 *     return { ...l, commitment };
 *
 * Keeping the rate is right within a family and wrong across one. Switch an annual line
 * to monthly and a **per-YEAR** rate stays on a **per-MONTH** line: a twelvefold
 * overcharge, on a quote, with nothing on screen to show it.
 *
 * Not hypothetical. Live quote Q-TEST-2026-27-0009 carries `commitment: "monthly"` with
 * `rate: 3240` and `cost: 1320` — 270x12 and 110x12 against a catalogue of ₹270/₹110 —
 * and its item's `prices` column is `{}`, so it took exactly this fallback. ₹38,232 was
 * recorded against it for one month of ten seats that should cost ₹3,186.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS ARITHMETIC AND NOT PRICING ─────────────────────────────────
 * Dividing by twelve converts a unit; it does not decide a price. A real monthly-flex
 * tier usually costs MORE per month than a twelfth of the annual rate, which is exactly
 * why the catalogue path above is preferred and left untouched. This only rescues the
 * case where there is no tier to read — and getting the unit right is strictly better
 * than leaving it twelve times wrong.
