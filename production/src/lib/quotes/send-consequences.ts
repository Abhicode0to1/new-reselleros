/**
 * What sending a quote to a customer commits you to.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THE DIALOG SAID BEFORE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Email a copy of the quote PDF to {customer}. The customer-facing accept link is
 * included automatically."
 *
 * Accurate, and it describes the mechanism rather than the commitment. Three things
 * were missing, and the operator could not have inferred any of them from that
 * sentence:
 *
 *   1. **The price stops being a draft.** Once it is in their inbox the customer will
 *      hold you to it, and there is no recall.
 *   2. **The accept link works without you.** They can accept it at any hour, and
 *      accepting is not a reply you get to consider — it moves the deal.
 *   3. **A resend is not a correction.** The old email is still in their inbox with the
 *      old figures, so two prices are now in the thread. That is the moment a customer
 *      asks "which one applies?", and the honest answer takes a phone call.
 *
 * ─── AND THE ONE THAT COSTS MONEY ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A quote whose stored total disagrees with its own subtotal × tax rate. That check
 * already exists but only on the INVOICE path (`useGenerateInvoice`'s pre-flight,
 * added 21 Aug 2026 after finding one production quote ₹8,165 under-charged). Sending
 * comes first in the real sequence, so the wrong figure reaches the customer before
 * anything checks it — and by then the number is quoted, not just stored.
