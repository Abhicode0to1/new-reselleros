/**
 * Turning an inbound enquiry into a draft quote — the decision, separated from the writing.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Traced on 23 Aug 2026, asked as "50 Business Starter ka quote maangu to email par aa
 * jayega?". The answer was no, and the break was not where it looked: `/buy/workspace`
 * already auto-creates a draft quote from a form submission, but the inbound-email webhook
 * only ever inserted a lead. Nothing on the email path has ever produced a quote.
 *
 * The webhook is a 700-line route that has already been the source of two shipped bugs
 * (a lead created from our own forwarded mail; a reply spam-filtered off its own thread).
 * Putting money arithmetic inline there would make it a third. So the ARITHMETIC and the
 * REFUSALS live here, where they can be tested against a table of inputs, and the route
 * keeps only the writing.
 *
 * ─── IT MOSTLY REFUSES, AND SAYS WHY ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four of the five outcomes are refusals. That is the point: a quote nobody asked for, or
 * one built on a seat count nobody read correctly, is worse than no quote — it is a
 * five-figure GST document with a wrong number on it, and it consumes an irreversible
 * number from the gapless Rule 46 series to do so. Every refusal carries a reason the
 * operator can act on, per CLAUDE.md §24; none of them is a silent null.
 *
 * ─── THE TERM IS ANNUAL, AND THAT IS A CHOICE ───────────────────────────────
 * An email says "50 Business Starter". It does not say monthly or annual, and there is no
 * honest way to read one out of the other. Annual is used because:
 *   - `buildWorkspaceLines` (the form path) already commits to `annual_yearly`, and two
 *     paths quoting the same product on different terms would be worse than either choice;
 *   - the output is a DRAFT. A human opens it before a customer ever sees it, and the term
 *     is the first thing on the line.
 * The choice is stated on the quote's own notes field by the caller, so whoever opens the
 * draft reads "annual, assumed" rather than discovering it from the arithmetic.
 *
 * If auto-SENDING is ever wired to this, that reasoning stops holding — an assumed term
 * that no human checked would reach the customer. Revisit here first.

   * Before it, a monthly quote was built as `rate: monthlyMsrp` — the ANNUAL tier's rate on a

   * quote the AI path produced was about 17% under, and `commitment-rate.ts`'s own header says
   * why that direction is wrong on purpose:
   *
   *   "the monthly tier usually costs MORE per month than a twelfth of the annual rate"
   *
   * Confirmed as ₹325 by Pardeep before this changed. Nothing here guesses a monthly price.
