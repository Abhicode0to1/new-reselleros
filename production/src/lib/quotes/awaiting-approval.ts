/**
 * Who can clear a pending quote, and whose queue it belongs in.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The quote page said "Waiting for the owner to approve. It is in their approvals queue."
 * Three things were wrong with that sentence, and only the first is cosmetic:
 *
 *   1. It says "the owner" as though there is one. ANUTECH has three.
 *   2. It named nobody, so the person who raised the quote could not tell whether it was
 *      waiting on them. Pardeep raised this one, and cannot approve his own quote —
 *      canApprove refuses that outright — so "the owner" meant someone else entirely.
 *   3. There WAS no approvals queue. No screen listed pending approvals and the quotes
 *      list had no approval filter, so the other owner had no way of knowing. The only
 *      working mechanism was the sentence's afterthought: "nudge them".
 *
 * ─── ONE PREDICATE, THREE SURFACES ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The sidebar badge, the list filter and this module must agree exactly.
 * useNavBadges already carries that rule in writing — a badge reading "Leads 14" over a
 * page showing nothing was a real dogfood bug — so `awaitsMyApproval` is the single test,
 * used by all three.
 *
 * ─── THE STORED TIER IS THE ONE THAT COUNTS ─────────────────────────────────
 * This reads `approval_tier` off the quote rather than recomputing it from the current
 * numbers. The stored tier is what was actually asked for; a recomputation can differ
 * because the quote has been edited since, and that difference is what `isStale` in
 * approval.ts is for. Deciding "may this person clear it" from a tier nobody requested
 * would let an edit quietly change who is in charge of a sign-off.
