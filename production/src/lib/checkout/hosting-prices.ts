/**
 * What a hosting plan costs — the ONE place the figure is computed.
 *
 * Checkout charges a hosting line by `hostingRate` (lib/checkout/cart-checkout.ts), and
 * `GET /api/public/hosting-prices` publishes `hostingPriceTable()` so the DMS panel shows
 * exactly what will be charged instead of keeping its own copy (owner, 28 Sep 2026: "Read
 * prices live from ResellerOS"). The inputs are LANDING_PLANS via HOSTING_TIERS
 * (site/lib/data/hosting-landing-v2.ts). Whole rupees throughout (AGENTS.md §1).
 *
 * GST: checkout applies 18% to the order's subtotal, once (`Math.round(subtotal × 1.18)`), so
 * for an order of one hosting line `inclGst` here is exactly what is paid.
