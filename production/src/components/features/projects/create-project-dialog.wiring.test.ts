/**
 * R-002 — a project sale is filed against a real customer, not a typed name.
 *
 * A source scan, because the defect was WIRING: the dialog rendered a perfectly good
 * text input and passed `customerId: null` to a mutation that accepts an id. Nothing
 * about that fails a unit test, and the damage only appears later — in a Ledger that
 * never shows the sale, and in "Excel Tech" quietly being a different party from
 * "Excel Technologies".
