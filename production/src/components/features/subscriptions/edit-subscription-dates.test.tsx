// Correcting a start date must move the renewal date with it, KEEPING THE TERM.
//
// ─── WHY THIS TEST EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Reported 9 Sep 2026. The two date fields were independent, so fixing a mis-typed
// start date left the renewal where it was — and the subscription silently gained or
// lost however many days the correction moved. Nothing flags it: the renewal cron bills
// from the renewal date, so a term quietly stretched by a week just bills a week late,
// for ever.
//
// The subtle half is the TERM LENGTH. A flex subscription's term is ONE month. Assuming
// twelve would turn a corrected monthly plan into an annual commitment inside the one
// dialog that promises "corrects the record only — it doesn't re-bill". So the term is
// read off the record's own start→renewal gap, and that is what the last case pins.
