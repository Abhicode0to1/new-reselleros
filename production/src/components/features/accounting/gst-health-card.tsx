/**
 * GST health — invoices whose tax head cannot be justified.
 *
 * ─── WHY A CARD AND NOT A BADGE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The findings are not "3 problems". They are a rupee figure and a list of names, and
 * both are needed to decide whether to act today. A count alone ("3 GST issues") gets
 * postponed; "Rs 3,10,207 of GST resting on a place of supply nobody established, across
 * these nine customers" does not.
 *
 * ─── WHEN IT IS CLEAN IT SAYS SO ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not disappear. An absent card and a card that has not loaded look identical,
 * and on this screen the difference is "your books are fine" versus "you have not been
 * told yet" — the exact bug fixed on the subscription card on 21 Aug, where a paid
 * subscription rendered nothing and blank space was left to mean "Paid".
 *
 * ─── IT NEVER OFFERS TO FIX ANYTHING ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every action links to the CUSTOMER, because that is where the cause lives and one edit
 * clears all of their findings. Nothing here edits an invoice: a tax head cannot be
 * corrected by changing an issued document, that needs a credit note (CGST s.34), and a
 * one-click "fix" would produce books that disagree with the paper the customer holds.
