/**
 * The money flow as a LIST, not a waterfall.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS REPLACED THE WATERFALL AS THE DEFAULT ─────────────────────────
 * Pardeep's words, after using it: *"isko samjhane me dimag lagana pad raha hai"* — and
 * that Profit by Vendor was easier and more interactive. He was right, and the reason is
 * worth writing down because it applies to every chart in this app.
 *
 * Four things made the waterfall hard:
 *
 *   1. THE GAP. A floating bar leaves empty space above and below it, and the reader has
 *      no way to know whether the gap means something. It does not — it is geometry.
 *   2. TWO REDS AND TWO GREENS. Licence cost and Running costs were both red; Gross margin
 *      and Net profit both green. Five bars, three colours, and the reader has to decode
 *      which red is which before reading anything.
 *   3. A FLOATING BAR MEANS "SUBTRACTED". That is an analyst's convention. Nobody who has
 *      not been taught it can infer it, and being wrong about it silently inverts the
 *      chart.
 *   4. ₹67,000 IS STILL FOUR PIXELS. The scale problem survives every styling fix.
 *
 * Profit by Vendor works because it is a list of rows, each readable on its own line, with
 * a picture attached. So this is that shape:
 *
 *   • THREE HEADINGS a non-accountant reads instantly — Money in, Money out, What's left.
 *     The grouping does the work the colours were failing to do.
 *   • EVERY BAR STARTS AT THE LEFT. Comparing lengths from a shared baseline is the
 *     easiest judgement the eye makes; comparing floating rectangles is among the hardest.
 *   • THE NUMBER IS TEXT. A 7% row is unreadable as a bar and perfectly readable as
 *     "₹66,998 · 7% of sales", so the bar is decoration and the text is the data.
 *   • ROWS LOOK CLICKABLE. A chevron and a hover state, because the waterfall's bars were
 *     clickable and nothing said so.
