//
// The predicate behind this strip is covered in lib/quotes/awaiting-approval.test.ts.
// What is checked here is the half a predicate test cannot reach: that the strip actually
// appears, says a number a person can act on, and disappears when the queue is empty.
//
// It exists because this cannot be browser-verified from this machine — the single pending
// quote in the live books was raised by the only login available, and nobody may approve
// their own quote, so the real app correctly shows this strip to no one. The count query
// was measured against the live database instead (Deepak 1, Sriganga 1, Pardeep 0), and
// this covers the rendering that measurement cannot see.
