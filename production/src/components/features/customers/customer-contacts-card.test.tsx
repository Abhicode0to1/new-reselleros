// A customer's contacts — the rules that must hold on screen.
//
// ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The same fact used to live in three places, two of them dead: the flat
// `customers.contact_*` columns, a `contact_persons` jsonb nobody filled, and a
// `contacts` table with a `customer_id` and zero rows. Abhishek's decision, 10 Sep
// 2026: ONE identity — several people per customer, with roles, at least one
// mandatory, and one PRIMARY who receives invoices and payment reminders.
//
// Two of those rules are easy to lose in a refactor and expensive to lose in
// production: the first contact must become primary automatically (otherwise an
// invoice has nobody to go to), and the last contact must not be removable
// (otherwise a customer exists that cannot be invoiced or chased). Both are pinned
// here; the database backs the primary rule with a UNIQUE index.
