/**
 * Send a teammate a password-reset link, from the Team page.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS IS SAFE, AND WHY IT IS ONLY CONVENIENCE ───────────────────────
 * `resetPasswordForEmail` is a PUBLIC Supabase call — anyone can trigger one for any
 * address, which is why the confirmation never says whether an account exists. So this
 * button grants an owner nothing they did not already have. What it removes is the trip to
 * the Supabase dashboard, which the app never mentioned to anybody.
 *
 * The owner never learns or sets the password. The link goes to the teammate's own mailbox
 * and only they can complete it. That distinction is why this is a "send link" button and
 * not a "set password" field: an owner who can type a colleague's password can also read
 * their private vault by signing in as them.
 *
 * Asked for on 22 Aug 2026 while trying to get sales@anutech.in signed in — there was no way
 * to reset a teammate's password from anywhere in the app.
