/* R-069 — Add Lead: the stepper says "1 Contact › 2 Enquiry › 3 Review", but "Next" on step 2
   CREATED the lead; the Review step never showed.

   Why: the footer is `step < 3 ? <Button type="button">Next</Button> : <Button type="submit">`.
   Same component, same slot, no key — so React reuses the ONE <button> DOM node and only
   flips its `type`. Next's onClick awaits `trigger()`, which resolves in the microtask
   checkpoint that runs right after the click listener returns; setStep(3) is a discrete
   update and commits there too. By the time the browser runs the click's activation
   behaviour, the button it is activating is already type="submit" — the form submits.
   (jsdom runs microtasks after the whole dispatch, so a render test would not reproduce it;
   this is a source contract, in the style of url-query-preserved.test.ts.) */
