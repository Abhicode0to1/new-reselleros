/**
 * Money — the one way a rupee figure is rendered.
 *
 * WHY: `rupee()` returns a string, so the typography was up to each of ~120
 * files. Most got `tabular-nums` right; some didn't, and a non-tabular figure
 * REFLOWS as it updates — the KPI strip visibly jitters while numbers land.
 * This component makes the correct treatment the default instead of a habit.
 *
 * TYPOGRAPHY — deliberately NOT `font-mono`.
 * CLAUDE.md §6 reserves mono for IDs, GSTIN and IRN, and gives big numbers the
 * serif face; the codebase already renders money as `font-serif tabular-nums`.
 * Switching ~900 call sites to mono would break that hierarchy for no gain —
 * what actually prevents the jitter is `tabular-nums`, which every variant here
 * sets. `display` keeps the serif; `cell` uses the UI sans at table density.
 *
 * SEMANTIC COLOUR (the roles are fixed — don't pass arbitrary classes):
 *   positive → emerald · paid, active, money in
 *   negative → rose    · overdue, suspended, money out
 *   muted    → ink-3   · secondary or historical figures
 *   default  → ink     · a neutral amount
