/**
 * A page that clips its own height must give every list inside it a way to scroll.
 *
 * ─── THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * /leads sets a fixed viewport height with `overflow-hidden` on its root wrapper, because
 * the Kanban board needs a bounded box to scroll columns inside. The Kanban branch and the
 * desktop table branch both carried `overflow-y-auto` and worked. The mobile/tablet card
 * list did not — so below `xl` the page rendered all 17 leads and showed two.
 *
 * It failed in the worst possible way: SILENTLY. No scrollbar appeared anywhere, every
 * number on the page was correct, the rows were all in the DOM, and the page just ended.
 * Measured in the running app on 21 Aug 2026 — 3217px of content inside a 666px box, and
 * `document.scrollingElement.scrollHeight === clientHeight`, so nothing could scroll at
 * all. Reported by the owner as "only 2 leads show but it says 17".
 *
 * ─── WHY A SOURCE SCAN AND NOT A RENDER TEST ────────────────────────────────
 * jsdom has no layout engine: it reports every height as 0, so a rendered card list looks
 * identical whether it can scroll or not. The thing that went wrong is a class on an
 * element, and that is what is checked here. Crude, and it would have caught this.
 *
 * A sweep of the running app confirmed /leads was the only page affected — customers,
 * quotes, invoices and payments all let the document scroll instead. This test is scoped
 * to the pages that actually clip, so it stays true rather than becoming a rule nobody
 * can satisfy.

/**

 * Both classes must be UNPREFIXED, and that qualifier is the whole accuracy of this test.
 * The first version asked only "does some line carry both classes", and it flagged
 * customers/page.tsx — whose clipping element is `hidden md:flex … overflow-hidden
 * xl:h-[calc(100vh-200px)]`, an inner panel that is only tall at `xl`, sitting beside a
 * `md:hidden` card list that only exists BELOW md. The two are never on screen together,
 * so it cannot clip that list, and the running page confirmed it: /customers scrolls the
 * document and clips nothing.
 *
 * That false positive mattered more than the miss would have. Someone would have "fixed"
 * a page that was never broken, or deleted the test — and a test people delete protects
 * nothing. A breakpoint-conditional height cannot clip a list that lives at a different
 * breakpoint, so it is not scanned.
