/**
 * Activation queue — seats a customer has paid for and nobody has turned on.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `provisioning_requests` has been written by the payment webhook since
 * 20260825220000, and NOTHING has ever opened it. Its own migration comment
 * calls itself "the only list anybody opens"; no screen read it, no nav entry
 * pointed at it, and no query selected from it outside the cron. So a customer
 * whose payment could not be auto-activated waited, and the queue recording
 * that fact was invisible.
 *
 * Nothing drains it automatically and that is deliberate: there is no Google
 * reseller API adapter yet, and a test-mode payment must never auto-activate.
 * The workflow is "activate the seats in the vendor's console, then tick the
 * row off", which needs the queue to be legible before it needs to be clever.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not offer a way to edit payment_mode, blocker, seats, amount_paid,
 * vendor or quote. Those are the record of what was paid for, and migration
 * 20260921100000 makes them unwritable by a tenant member at the DATABASE, not
 * just here — so the gate that stops a test payment activating real seats is
 * two independent layers rather than one wearing the shape of two. A button
 * here would be the third, and the weakest.
