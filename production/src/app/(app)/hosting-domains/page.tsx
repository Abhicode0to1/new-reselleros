/**
 * Hosting & Domains — the way into the DMS engine.
 *
 * Hosting and domains are run by a separate application (DMS, app.anutech.in):
 * it holds the ResellerClub and DirectAdmin credentials, registers the domains,
 * creates the hosting accounts, and has its own admin panel and customer portal.
 * None of that is moving here. This page is the door.
 *
 * ─── WHY A PAGE AND NOT JUST A SIDEBAR LINK ──────────────────────────────────
 * `NavItem.external` would have given us a one-line link straight to DMS. It was
 * not enough: a bare link tells you nothing until you have already clicked it
 * and waited. When somebody opens this because a customer's hosting is broken,
 * the first question is whether the engine is even up — so the page answers that
 * before offering the link, and distinguishes the three failures that otherwise
 * look identical from here: not configured, wrong key, unreachable.
 *
 * The link is still offered when the engine is down, deliberately: someone
 * investigating a broken app should not be stopped by the page that reports it
 * as broken.
