/**
 * POST /api/catalog/sync-hosting — seed/refresh THIS tenant's hosting catalogue
 * from the two directly-connected sources of truth (merge, 2 Sep 2026):
 *
 *   • SPECS (disk + bandwidth)  ← DirectAdmin, read live from the server that
 *     actually provisions the account (lib/directadmin). This is authoritative:
 *     it is the quota the customer really gets. Verified 2 Sep — the disk quotas
 *     matched the marketing page exactly, but bandwidth did NOT (page promised
 *     100/200/Unmetered GB while the packages enforce 20/30/40 GB). Pardeep's
 *     ruling: the server is the truth, so the page was corrected to match, and
 *     the catalogue takes its specs from here, never from the page.
 *   • PRICE + name + features   ← LANDING_PLANS (hosting-landing.ts), Anutech's
 *     own numbers. DirectAdmin holds no selling price, so price can only come
 *     from our own config.
 *
 * This replaces the previous version, which fetched the DMS engine
 * (app.anutech.in) — undeployable since its GCP owner account was lost. Same
 * atomic, owner-only RPC underneath (`sync_hosting_catalog`); this route only
 * authenticates, reads DA, merges, and hands the plans over. It NEVER writes to
 * DirectAdmin — creating/altering an account is a separate, gated module.
 *
 * A DA package with no matching priced plan is SKIPPED (never seeded at ₹0) and
 * named in the response, so nothing is ever put on sale without a real price.
