/**
 * GET /api/inbound-emails — the Enquiries inbox.
 *
 * ─── THIS ROUTE HAD NO AUTH AT ALL, AND IT USES THE SERVICE ROLE ────────────
 * Found 30 Aug 2026 while reviewing the Enquiries screen. Two separate holes, and the
 * second one did not even need a signed-out attacker:
 *
 *   1. There was no `if (!user)` anywhere. `/api` is NOT in the middleware's
 *      PROTECTED_PREFIXES (that list gates `/enquiries`, the PAGE — not the endpoint
 *      behind it), so an anonymous GET reached this handler, fell through to
 *      DEFAULT_TENANT_ID, and was answered with ANUTECH's whole inbox: customer names,
 *      email addresses, phone numbers and every message body.
 *
 *   2. Worse, and live for a properly signed-in user: when the resolved tenant had zero
 *      rows, the handler ran a SECOND query with NO tenant filter —
 *      `select * from inbound_emails order by created_at limit 50` — and returned that.
 *      Delfos Technologies and Excel Technologies both hold 0 inbound emails today, so
 *      either of their users opening this screen would have been served ANUTECH's 32.
 *      A "local preview" convenience became a cross-tenant read in production.
 *
 * `createAdminClient` is the service role: it bypasses RLS, so RLS could not save this.
 * When the admin client is used, the tenant filter IS the security boundary, and a
 * fallback that drops the filter drops the boundary.
 *
 * ─── THE SIBLINGS WERE ALWAYS RIGHT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `[id]/state` and `[id]/reply` both require a user, resolve `me.tenant_id`, and scope
 * every query by it. That is the shape copied below — this route was the odd one out,
 * which is why this is an oversight and not a design.
 *
 * ─── DEMO MODE IS KEPT, BUT GATED THE SAME WAY MIDDLEWARE GATES IT ──────────
 * Local UI review runs signed-out (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`), and that is genuinely
 * useful. The guard below is character-for-character the one in middleware.ts, including
 * `NODE_ENV === "development"`, so a production build cannot take this branch no matter
 * what is set in the environment — and the two cannot drift into disagreeing.

/**
 * Only ever used by the signed-out local demo below. Never a production fallback.
 *
 * ─── `BUY_PAGE_TENANT_ID` USED TO BE SECOND IN THIS CHAIN, AND IT IS WRONG ───
 * It holds `8ff50dbf-e17e-4210-a580-0df7b1a6f71b`, which matches NO tenant in the live
 * database — there are three, and that is none of them. So the "default tenant" this
 * route claimed to fall back to has been resolving to nothing the whole time, and the
 * ONLY reason the local demo ever showed mail was the cross-tenant fallback removed
 * below. Closing that hole is what made the emptiness visible; the emptiness was
 * already there.
 *
 * It is also the wrong CONCEPT: it names the tenant whose products the public buy page
 * sells, which has no reason to be the tenant whose inbox a developer wants to look at.
 * Two unrelated ideas sharing one variable is how one of them silently goes stale.
