/**
 * GET /api/tenant/pay-methods — can this workspace take a Razorpay payment?
 *
 * R-038. The invoice PDF may only name a payment route the seller actually has, and
 * that fact lives in `tenant_secrets`, which is owner-only under RLS. The customer-
 * facing PDF (`/api/v1/documents/invoice/[id]/pdf`) reads it with the admin client and
 * is fine; the IN-APP "Download PDF" button runs in the browser, as whatever staff
 * member pressed it, and cannot.
 *
 * Without this, the same invoice would download differently depending on which door it
 * came out of — the drift this codebase keeps paying for (see the logo comment in
 * quotes/[id]/page.tsx: "a logo on one and a monogram on the other is the kind of
 * difference nobody reports and everybody notices").
 *
 * What it returns is a yes/no, never a credential: no key id, no prefix, no mask. The
 * mode is already surfaced by the owner-only integrations route for the people
 * entitled to see it. Any authenticated member of the tenant may ask this question,
 * because any of them can print an invoice.
