/**
 * GET /api/admin/feedback/platform — every tenant's feedback, for the platform owner.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS ROUTE EXISTS AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A tester was given his own tenant (Delfos Technologies) precisely so he could file bug
 * reports against the app. He filed one on 22 Aug. Nobody could read it: `feedback` carries
 * `feedback_select USING (tenant_id = current_tenant_id())`, so /admin/feedback shows the
 * signed-in workspace and nothing else. Reporting worked, reading did not, and the feature
 * could not do the job it was built for.
 *
 * ─── WHY A ROUTE AND NOT A WIDER RLS POLICY ─────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious fix is a policy letting the distributor read every row. It is the wrong one.
 * A policy is invisible at the call site: every existing query through the browser client
 * would silently start returning other companies' data, including ones written later by
 * someone who never knew the policy changed. Isolation would then be a thing you have to
 * remember rather than a thing the database enforces.
 *
 * So RLS stays exactly as strict as it is, and the one place allowed to cross the boundary
 * is here — server-side, service-role, behind an explicit check, and impossible to reach
 * by accident from a component.
 *
 * ─── GATED ON THE EXISTING FOUNDER ALLOWLIST, NOT ON A NEW RULE ─────────────
 * lib/platform.ts already answers "who is the platform". I started to gate this on
 * `role = 'owner' AND tenant.tier = 'distributor'` and that would have been a SECOND
 * definition of god-mode, weaker than the one already there — a tier is a database column,
 * so anyone who can write to `tenants` could grant it to themselves. The allowlist is
 * deployment configuration and cannot be reached from inside the app. Its own comment says
 * exactly this: "a tenant can never flip a flag to get in".
 *
 * So one definition, re-checked here server-side against the AUTHENTICATED email — the
 * client copy of the flag only decides whether a toggle is drawn.
 *
 * The bar is deliberately higher than the page's. nav.ts opens /admin/feedback to owner and
 * manager, noting that reports quote whatever the reporter typed and that regularly
 * includes a customer's name. Crossing tenants means OTHER companies' customers.
