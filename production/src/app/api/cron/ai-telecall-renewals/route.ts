/**
 * AI renewal calls — ring the customers whose subscription renews in five days.
 *
 * Schedule: once daily, via CLOUD SCHEDULER (scripts/setup-cloud-scheduler.sh). NOT
 * vercel.json — the live deployment is Cloud Run, where Vercel crons do not exist and that
 * file is inert.
 * Local dev: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" localhost:3000/api/cron/ai-telecall-renewals`.
 *
 * ─── EXACTLY FIVE DAYS OUT, NOT "WITHIN FIVE DAYS" ──────────────────────────
 * The brief says "expiring in 5 days" and both readings are defensible, so the reason for
 * choosing one is written down. A `<= 5 days` window makes every customer eligible on five
 * consecutive days. `decideTelecall`'s 24-hour gap would then let four of those five calls
 * through, and the customer's phone rings on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday about the
 * same renewal. Four automated calls in four days is how a business gets its number blocked,
 * and the fourth is not more persuasive than the first.
 *
 * An exact date means each subscription is a candidate exactly once. A run that is missed —
 * scheduler outage, deploy window — skips that day's cohort rather than calling them late; the
 * renewal EMAIL cadence (api/cron/renewals) still covers them, and a phone call about a
 * renewal that already lapsed is worse than no phone call.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS CRON DOES NOT DECIDE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Whether to dial. `dispatchTelecall` owns the autonomy dial, the calling-hours rule, the
 * 24-hour gap and the attempt ceiling. Today `telecall.place` defaults to `hold`, so a healthy
 * run of this cron writes `held` rows and rings nobody — and the operator's queue is the
 * result. That is the intended steady state until Pardeep moves the dial at /automation.
