/**
 * Renew-domains worker — turns a PAID domain renewal in the provisioning queue into a
 * real renewal, through the DMS engine's `domain.renew` command (25 Sep 2026: "Handle
 * the domain renewals too"). The twin of register-domains, for rows whose plan is
 * DOMAIN_RENEWAL_PLAN, which the payment webhook writes when a renewal quote of a
 * vendor-`domain` subscription is paid.
 *
 * ─── WHAT MUST BE TRUE BEFORE A LIVE COMMAND IS SENT ────────────────────────
 *   1. DOMAIN_RENEWAL_LIVE=1 on THIS server (the paying side's gate);
 *   2. the row was fully approved by decideProvisioning: a live, verified, full
 *      payment, and the `provisioning.activate` dial on auto — otherwise it carries a
 *      blocker and is never listed here;
 *   3. the tenant's kill switch is off (checked per row, fails closed);
 *   4. the domain's CURRENT expiry is known. It is read from DMS and sent as
 *      `expiryBefore`; the engine renews only if the registrar still agrees, so a
 *      renewal somebody already made is refused instead of bought twice (DMS L108).
 * The ENGINE then applies its own gate (ENGINE_DOMAIN_RENEW_LIVE=1) and its spend
 * limit, and holds anything outside it for a person.
 *
 * ─── L1: WHAT RETRIES IT, WHO IS TOLD, HOW A FAILURE IS NOTICED ─────────────
 *   Retries: the scheduler re-runs this; one commandId per row per IST day, so a
 *     re-run the same day is a free replay.
 *   Told: the tenant owner is emailed when a renewal needs reconciling or is refused.
 *     Holds are written to the row's note, which the /provisioning screen shows.
 *   Noticed later: every row stays `queued` with a note until activated or failed.
 *
 * Auth: Bearer(CRON_SECRET) or a signed-in owner, like register-domains.
