/**
 * AI sales follow-up cron — drains `ai_sales_loops`.
 *
 * Schedule: hourly, via CLOUD SCHEDULER (scripts/setup-cloud-scheduler.sh). NOT vercel.json
 * — the live deployment is Cloud Run, where Vercel crons do not exist and that file is inert.
 * Local dev: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" localhost:3000/api/cron/ai-sales-loop`.
 *
 * Hourly, not daily, because the agent schedules in HOURS (SALES_AGENT_SCHEMA bounds
 * in_hours at 1..720). A daily sweep would round every "chase them this afternoon" up to a
 * day and make the shortest useful follow-up impossible to express.
 *
 * What it does, for each due row:
 *   1. Re-read the lead. `shouldNudge` then decides whether the row is DUE or merely STALE —
 *      the customer may have replied, the deal may be won or lost, a person may have taken
 *      it over. See lib/ai/sales-loops.ts for why a timestamp comparison cannot know this.
 *   2. If it should nudge: run the agent with the trigger condition as its brief, and
 *      dispatch through the same path an inbound message uses.
 *   3. Close the row either way, with the outcome in words.
 *
 * ─── THE BRAKE APPLIES HERE TOO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every send goes through `dispatchSalesDecision`, so the autonomy dial and the kill switch
 * gate this cron exactly as they gate the webhook. `followup.send` is the action, and it
 * ships as `hold` — see lib/ai/autonomy.ts. Until somebody moves that dial this cron drafts
 * follow-ups onto lead timelines and sends nothing, which is the intended first state.
 *
 * ─── ONE LEAD CAN NEVER BE NUDGED TWICE BY ONE RUN ──────────────────────────
 * A unique partial index on (tenant_id, lead_id) WHERE status='pending' means one pending row
 * per lead, so the due list cannot contain the same lead twice. Idempotency across runs comes
 * from closing the row before the next sweep can see it.
