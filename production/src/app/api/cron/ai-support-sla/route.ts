/**
 * AI support SLA sweep — closes tickets the customer never came back to, and shouts when an
 * escalated ticket is still nobody's.
 *
 * Schedule: every 15 minutes, via CLOUD SCHEDULER (scripts/setup-cloud-scheduler.sh). NOT
 * vercel.json — the live deployment is Cloud Run, where Vercel crons do not exist and that file
 * is inert.
 * Local dev: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" localhost:3000/api/cron/ai-support-sla`.
 *
 * ─── WHY 15 MINUTES AND NOT HOURLY ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The auto-close is a 48-hour decision and would be happy with a daily run. The other half is a
 * THIRTY-MINUTE promise, and a sweep that runs hourly cannot keep it — the alert would land
 * anywhere between 30 and 90 minutes after the escalation, so the number in the alert would be a
 * fiction and the desk would learn to distrust it. The cheaper half sets the cadence.
 *
 * ─── THE BRAKE DOES NOT APPLY HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ──────────────────
 * Neither thing this cron does sends anything to a customer. Closing a ticket for silence is a
 * state change on our own row, and the breach alert goes to OUR OWN desk. The autonomy dial
 * exists to stop what the app sends OUT to other people and must never be able to silence what
 * the app says TO US — the same rule that removed `compliance.send` from the registry. A kill
 * switch that also muted "this ticket has waited 40 minutes" would turn one busy morning into a
 * customer discovering we never answered.
