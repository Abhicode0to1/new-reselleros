/**
 * POST /api/leads/[id]/draft-reply — write the reply this customer's last message deserves.
 *
 * Asked for on 23 Aug 2026: "me chahta hu ai human ki tarah reply de jaise ek real sales
 * person ko ki enquiry ka reply dena chahiye vaise hi reply de."
 *
 * ─── IT DRAFTS. IT DOES NOT SEND. ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The draft comes back as text and lands in the composer the operator is already looking
 * at. Sending stays the existing one-tap action, unchanged. That is not a smaller version
 * of the feature — an email cannot be recalled, and the whole reason this reply is worth
 * drafting is that the customer has corrected us twice already. When an operator has read
 * twenty of these and trusts them, auto-send becomes a tenant setting; it is not a default
 * anybody should get by accident.
 *
 * ─── THE MODEL WRITES PROSE. IT DOES NOT PRODUCE FACTS. ─────────────────────
 * `buildReplyContext` assembles what a salesperson would know — the thread with our own
 * quoted words stripped out, the requirement marked confirmed or not, the quote total if
 * one was sent — and `verifyDraftMoney` then checks the draft against the figures that
 * were actually allowed. A draft containing any other amount is DISCARDED, not corrected:
 * the sentence around a wrong number was written to suit that number.
 *
 * ─── TENANT-SCOPED THROUGH THE SESSION CLIENT ───────────────────────────────
 * Every read here goes through the operator's own client, so RLS decides what this lead
 * and its thread are. No admin client, no tenant id from the caller.
