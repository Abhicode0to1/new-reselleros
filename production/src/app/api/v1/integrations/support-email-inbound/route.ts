/**
 * POST /api/v1/integrations/support-email-inbound
 *
 * Mail sent to support@ lands here — a forwarder (Cloudflare Email Routing / Postmark /
 * SendGrid / Mailgun, or the Apps Script forwarder this deployment already uses) POSTs the
 * parsed message, and the AI support agent answers it or fetches a person.
 *
 *   1. Verify the shared secret (INBOUND_EMAIL_SECRET) — fail closed.
 *   2. Normalise the provider payload.
 *   3. Claim the message id in `inbound_emails` (UNIQUE) → a provider retry cannot answer the
 *      same customer twice.
 *   4. Strip the quoted thread, then run the agent: find or open the ticket, understand the
 *      message, answer / ask / escalate.
 *   5. Record the ticket id back on the `inbound_emails` row, so the Inbox and the Support
 *      screen show the same event.
 *
 * ─── WHY A SECOND INGEST ENDPOINT RATHER THAN ONE MORE BRANCH ───────────────
 * `api/webhooks/inbound-email` already routes support@ to a `support` branch and opens a ticket
 * (lib/inbound/routing.ts), and that branch now runs this same agent — the two paths share
 * `runSupportAgentForMessage`, so there is one agent and one set of guards whichever door the
 * mail comes through.
 *
 * This endpoint exists because the two doors have genuinely different operational shapes. The
 * shared webhook is one URL a reseller points ALL their mail at, and it routes on the recipient
 * address; a support desk that wants its own forwarder, its own secret rotation and its own
 * failure mode should not have to share either. Pointing support@ here also removes the
 * classification step entirely: the URL is the statement of intent, which is stronger than an
 * address parsed out of a payload.
 *
 * ─── WHY IT SITS UNDER /api/v1 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Stated plainly because it is a genuine inconsistency: the rest of `/api/v1` is an
 * API-KEY-authenticated surface for customers (`lib/api-keys/auth.ts`), and this route is a
 * shared-secret webhook. It is here because the brief named this path, and the auth is the one
 * a mail forwarder can actually use — an inbound-parse provider cannot mint an API key. A
 * reader who expects every /api/v1 route to be key-authenticated should read the guard below,
 * not assume it.
 *
 * Public route — the secret is the only guard, matching the sales webhook's fail-closed posture.
 * Uses the admin client (no session): a mail provider is not one of our users.
