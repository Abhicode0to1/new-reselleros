/**
 * POST /api/v1/telecalling/webhook — what the call came to.
 *
 * The telephony vendor POSTs here when a call ends: transcript, duration, its own post-call
 * analysis. This route records it against the row that placed the call and, if the customer
 * asked for a quotation, hands off to the quote dispatcher.
 *
 *   1. Verify the signature — FAIL CLOSED, no secret means no request is trusted.
 *   2. Normalise whichever vendor sent it (lib/telecall/inbound.ts).
 *   3. Find the row WE wrote, by the vendor's call id, and take the tenant from that row.
 *   4. Classify the outcome, check what was said about money, record it.
 *   5. Quote, or fetch a human — once, however many times the vendor retries.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE TENANT IS NOT READ OUT OF THE BODY ─────────────────────────────
 * A signature proves a payload is AUTHENTIC, not that it is CORRECT. A mis-scripted vendor
 * agent echoing back the wrong metadata would, on a body-trusting endpoint, write a customer's
 * transcript — and possibly a quotation — into another reseller's workspace. The row this app
 * wrote when it placed the call is the authority; see findTelecallByProviderCallId.
 *
 * ─── WHY A 200 ON THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE ERRORS ──────────────────────────────
 * Both vendors retry on any non-2xx. An unknown call id is not a transient fault — it is a
 * call this deployment did not place (someone dialling from the vendor dashboard, or a second
 * deployment sharing the account), and answering 4xx would have them retrying it for hours. So
 * the refusal is logged and acknowledged. A genuine failure on OUR side returns 500, because
 * that IS worth retrying.
