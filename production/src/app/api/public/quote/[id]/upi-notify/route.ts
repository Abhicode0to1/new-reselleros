/**
 * POST /api/public/quote/[id]/upi-notify?t=<token>
 *
 * "I've sent the payment by UPI." Emails the reseller to go and check their account.
 *
 * ─── THIS ROUTE DELIBERATELY RECORDS NO PAYMENT ─────────────────────────────
 * A direct UPI transfer lands in the reseller's bank, not through a gateway, so there
 * is no webhook and nothing here can verify a rupee arrived. The only fact this
 * endpoint has is that somebody with the quote link says they paid.
 *
 * Turning that into a payment row would put an unverified amount into the reseller's
 * books — reconciled reports, GST filings and the customer's outstanding balance all
 * read from those rows. It would also be trivially abusable: the link is the only
 * credential, so "mark this quote paid" would be one curl away.
 *
 * So: no record_payment, no status change, no payment_status change. An email, and a
 * human decides. That is the whole endpoint, and the restraint is the feature.
