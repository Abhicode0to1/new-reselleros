/**
 * GET /api/invoices/{id}/pdf-link — a one-day signed link to the server-rendered Tax Invoice PDF
 * (5 Oct 2026).
 *
 * WHY: "Download PDF does not respond" (bug filed from AI Help). In the browser the react-pdf
 * render of an invoice could hang without ever resolving or throwing, so the button stayed in
 * its loading state forever and nothing downloaded. The server renders the very same InvoicePDF
 * component (it is what the customer is emailed), so when the in-browser render times out or
 * fails, the dialog falls back to this.
 *
 * Signed-in staff only, and only for an invoice their own RLS lets them read — the link is
 * minted for that invoice's tenant and lives one day.
