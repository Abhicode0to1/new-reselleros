/**
 * POST /api/integrations/email-provider/test — send one email to yourself.
 *
 * ─── IT CAN ONLY EVER EMAIL THE CALLER ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The recipient is taken from the session, never from the request body. That is
 * the whole safety property: this endpoint cannot be pointed at a customer by
 * anyone, including by a bug in a form I write later, and it cannot become a
 * relay if the URL leaks. A test button that accepts a `to` parameter is one
 * typo away from mailing a real customer a message that says "test".
 *
 * ─── IT PROVES THE WHOLE PATH, NOT A PIECE OF IT ─────────────────────────────
 * It goes through sendEmail with the tenant's `route`, so it exercises exactly
 * what a renewal reminder does: the provider decision, the Gmail token and its
 * scopes, the actual API call, and the email_log write. A test that bypassed any
 * of those would pass while the real thing failed — which is the failure mode
 * this whole day has been about.
