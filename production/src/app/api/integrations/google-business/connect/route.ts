/**
 * GET /api/integrations/google-business/connect
 *
 * Starts the Business Profile consent. Its own flow, cookie and callback — same reasoning
 * as google-gmail/connect: the consent screen must say what the button says, and revoking
 * one integration must not take the others down. Asks for the union of what this user has
 * already granted (contacts, gmail) so this consent cannot narrow them — see
 * lib/google/scope-union.ts for the August 2026 incident that rule comes from.
