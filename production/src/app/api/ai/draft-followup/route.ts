/**
 * POST /api/ai/draft-followup
 *
 * AI auto-draft (Roadmap Step 1) — drafts a short message for a LEAD or a
 * CUSTOMER (WhatsApp or email). ZERO money-write: it only returns editable
 * text; the operator reviews + sends via the existing WhatsApp/email actions.
 *
 * Two modes (exactly one of leadId / customerId):
 *   - leadId   → sales follow-up to a prospect (purpose 'followup')
 *   - customerId → either a warm check-in ('followup') or a polite payment
 *                  reminder ('reminder') for an existing customer.
 *
 * MONEY-HONESTY: when a money figure (outstanding balance) is relevant we pass
 * the REAL number in context and instruct the model to use it verbatim and
 * never invent/alter figures. The operator still edits before sending
 * (human-in-the-loop) — the draft is never sent automatically.
 *
 * Tenant-safe: the lead/customer is fetched via the operator's SESSION client
 * (RLS), so a user can only draft for their own tenant's records. Uses Gemini
 * Flash with a stub fallback (works even before GEMINI_API_KEY is set).
