/**
 * POST /api/vault/[id]/reveal — hand back exactly one secret, and record it.
 *
 * ─── WHY REVEALING IS A WRITE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is a POST, not a GET, and that is not pedantry about verbs. A GET is
 * something the browser, a prefetcher, or a link preview may perform on its own
 * — and every one of those would silently decrypt a customer's admin password
 * and write a row into the audit log saying a person looked at it. Reads that
 * cause an irreversible side effect must be requested deliberately.
 *
 * ─── THE LOG IS WRITTEN BEFORE THE SECRET GOES OUT ───────────────────────────
 * If the log insert fails, the reveal fails. An access trail that is best-effort
 * is not a trail: the one view anybody would ever want to hide is exactly the
 * one worth dropping. Slower and honest beats fast and deniable.
 *
 * This is also why `log_activity` is not used here. It returns silently without
 * writing when there is no JWT, which was discovered the hard way on this
 * project (638 rows in, 638 rows out). A security log needs its own table with
 * its own insert that can actually fail.
