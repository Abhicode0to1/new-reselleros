/**
 * Ad-click attribution for landing pages (R-139, 4 Oct 2026).
 *
 * A Google Ads click lands with ?gclid=…&utm_*=… on the URL. The lead endpoints already store
 * those (lib/marketing/utm.ts → captureFromRequest), but only when they SEE them: from the
 * body's `pageUrl`, else the Referer. A visitor who scrolls, clicks "Buy now" and moves to
 * /buy/workspace loses the gclid from the URL, and the lead arrives as "direct".
 *
 * So the landing page remembers the FIRST ad URL of the visit (sessionStorage) and:
 *   • sends it as `pageUrl` with the form, and
 *   • carries the ad params onto the Buy link, so the checkout's Referer still holds them.
 * Pure helpers here; storage access is wrapped because private windows can refuse it.
