/**
 * Every customer page that makes the customer WAIT on the server shows what is happening.
 *
 * Owner, 30 Sep 2026: "user gets no feedback at all … not just stuck at a page". Starting
 * a trial took up to 30 s behind a button that said only "Starting your trial…". The fix
 * is <BusyPanel> (components/ui/busy-panel.tsx): what is being done, a running seconds
 * count, and a "taking longer than usual" line.
 *
 * The rule this pins: a file under the public site, checkout and customer pages that POSTs
 * to the server while holding a busy state must render <BusyPanel>, unless it is listed
 * below with the reason its own screen already shows progress.
