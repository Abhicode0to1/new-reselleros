-- Correct the one subscription storing an ANNUAL figure in its monthly MRR field
-- ============================================================================
-- 23 Aug 2026, on the operator's instruction ("mrr theek kar do") after being shown the
-- measurement and the caveat below.
--
-- THE ROW
--   c398e832-0b58-4d78-a5b7-a2fdd1871fc9 — "Xyz cloud solutions"
--   10 seats · Google Workspace Business Starter · term_months = 1 · renewal 27 Aug
--   auto_renew = true
--   mrr = 32,400  →  ₹3,240 per seat per month, against a ₹270 catalogue price
--
-- It is the ONLY row in the database like this: a sweep of every subscription joined to
-- its catalogue item found exactly one above 2x the catalogue rate, and its ratio is
-- 12.00 — an annual figure in a monthly field, not a pricing decision.
--
-- WHY THIS MATTERED
-- create-renewal-quote.ts priced every renewal as `mrr * 12`, ignoring term_months. On
-- this row that came to ₹3,88,800 ex-GST — about 144x the correct ₹2,700 monthly charge —
-- four days out, on a subscription set to renew by itself. Commit 5dd1a73 makes the
-- pricing term-aware AND makes it refuse an annual-looking mrr rather than dividing by 12
-- to repair it, so the 144x quote can no longer be generated. This fixes the DATA so a
-- correct renewal quote can be.
--
-- ⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, STATED PLAINLY
-- The error did not start here. The originating quote Q-TEST-2026-27-0009 carries
-- `commitment: "monthly"` with `rate: 3240` and `cost: 1320` per seat — 270x12 and 110x12,
-- both ANNUAL figures on a line calling itself monthly — and a payment of ₹38,232 was
-- recorded against it. `mrr` faithfully copied that quote's subtotal.
--
-- So after this runs, the subscription (₹2,700/month) will disagree with the quote and
-- payment that created it (₹32,400 for one month). That is accepted deliberately: the
-- future renewal becomes correct, the history stays wrong, and the history is SANDBOX
-- data (Q-TEST prefix, tenant Delfos, domain "xyz.cloudsolutions"), so no real customer
-- was overcharged. Editing a paid quote to match would mean rewriting what was charged,
-- which is a different and much worse thing to do.
--
-- REVERSIBLE: the old value is in the notice below and in activity_log via the
-- subscriptions trigger.
