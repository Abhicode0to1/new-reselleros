-- Record the place of supply for nine customers who never had one.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A RECORD-KEEPING FIX AND NOT A TAX CORRECTION
--   lib/gst/mismatch.ts flagged nine customers with no state and no usable GSTIN whose
--   invoices had all gone out as intra-state (CGST + SGST). That head was never
--   DETERMINED — isInterStateSupply returns false for an unknown buyer, and false means
--   intra-state, so "we do not know" produced a confident Delhi invoice.
--
--   Pardeep confirmed on 22 Aug 2026 that all nine are in fact Delhi customers. So the
--   invoices already issued are CORRECT and no credit note is needed. What was missing was
--   the evidence, not the answer.
--
--   That distinction is the whole reason to ask before writing: had even one been outside
--   Delhi, this script would have been the wrong action and the right one would have been
--   a credit note under CGST s.34.
--
-- WHY BY ID AND NOT BY NAME
--   This book contains "AB corprotion", "abc corporaton" and "Excel Technologies", and one
--   of those — AB corprotion — is NOT in this list: it has a state already (32) and a
--   broken GSTIN, which is a different problem needing a different answer. Matching on
--   names that differ by two characters is how the wrong customer gets a tax attribute.
--
-- WHAT IT TOUCHES: customers.state_code and customers.state, on nine ids, and nothing
-- else. No invoice, no tax amount, no GSTIN.
--
-- GUARDED so a re-run or a since-corrected row is a no-op rather than an overwrite: the
-- WHERE clause requires the state to still be empty. If somebody has filled one in
-- meanwhile — with a different state — this leaves it alone, which is correct, because
-- their information is newer than mine.
