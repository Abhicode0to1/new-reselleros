--  CREATE THE TESTING SANDBOX TENANT
--  Written 21 Aug 2026, on Pardeep's decision: testers must not write into the
--  tenant holding the real books.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
--  ─── WHY A SEPARATE TENANT AND NOT "JUST BE CAREFUL" ──────────────────────
--  Measured 21 Aug 2026, the live tenant holds 14 customers, 25 quotes, 21
--  invoices, 23 payments and 28 subscriptions. Those are PER-TENANT counts; the
--  DB-wide totals are higher (15/27/22/24/30) because the historical Excel
--  Technologies tenant holds the difference. Mixing the two is how a per-tenant
--  assertion ends up written against a global number — which is exactly what
--  happened on the first run of this file, and why the guards below caught it.
--  This project is on the Supabase
--  free plan: no PITR, no automatic backups (docs/BACKUP.md). A tester's junk
--  rows would mix into those, every dashboard total would count them, and
--  separating them afterwards means reading a tester's mind. RLS is already
--  tenant-scoped on every table, so a second tenant is a real wall, not a
--  convention.
--
--  ─── THE NAME IS DELIBERATELY UGLY ────────────────────────────────────────
--  Tenant names in this product are derived from an email domain, so a wrong
--  tenant reads exactly like the right one -- that is how a private "Excel
--  Technologies" tenant held two days of real work and a ₹21,240 payment before
--  anyone noticed (CLAUDE.md §4a). This one is named so that nobody can mistake
--  it for a company, and it sorts to the bottom of any list.
--
--  ─── WHAT IS SEEDED, AND WHAT IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────
--  Seeded: the item catalogue, copied from the live tenant (25 rows, new ids).
--  Typing a price list is tedious and proves nothing.
--
--  NOT seeded: customers, leads, quotes, invoices, payments. Those are the
--  money spine -- lead → quote → pay → invoice → renewal -- and creating them
--  IS the test. Handing a tester finished rows would skip the thing being
--  tested and hide every bug in the creating.
--
--  ─── HOW A TESTER GETS IN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
--  Not by a password anyone shares. `team_invites` pins an exact email address
--  to a tenant, and the OAuth callback's first branch joins an invited address
--  to THAT tenant -- so a Google sign-in lands in this sandbox and cannot land
--  in the live tenant. Run add-test-tenant-invite.sql with the tester's address.
--
--  Safe to re-run: every statement is idempotent.
