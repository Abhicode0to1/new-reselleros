-- Read-only. Asserts what each person can actually see through RLS, from their own seat.
-- Writes nothing and ends in rollback, so it is safe against production at any time.
-- Run: cd production && env -u SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN npx supabase db query --linked \
--        -f supabase/maintenance/verify-reporting-lines.sql
-- A green run prints one row: MEASURED-OK. Any drift raises with the person and both counts.
--
-- ⚠ CORRECTED 20 Aug 2026 -- the first version of this file passed without measuring
-- anything. It drove its loop off `select ... from public.users` AFTER `set local role
-- authenticated`, and at that moment there is no JWT, so auth.uid() is null, RLS hides
-- every row, the loop ran ZERO times and the file printed MEASURED-OK having checked
-- nobody. It was found by a different tool disagreeing (scripts/org-chart-sync.mjs), not
-- by this file failing -- a vacuous test cannot fail.
--
-- Two changes make that unrepeatable:
--   1. the roster is read BEFORE dropping to `authenticated`, and carried in a GUC;
--   2. the loop counts its own iterations and raises unless it measured every person.
-- The second one matters more than the first: it turns "measured nobody" from a pass
-- into a failure, whatever future edit reintroduces the mistake.
--
-- The expected numbers below are the 20 Aug 2026 measurement of ANUTECH's 10 users and
-- 19 leads. Update them deliberately, with a note, when the book changes -- never to make
-- a red run go green. A new teammate also turns this red (the roster-size check), which
-- is intentional: a person nobody measured is exactly the person to look at.
