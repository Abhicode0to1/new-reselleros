-- Auto-generated from SOURCE Supabase pg_policies (7 Sep 2026).
-- Recreates the app RLS policies that were missing on Cloud SQL. Idempotent (DROP IF EXISTS + CREATE).
--
-- Only a table's OWNER may CREATE POLICY on it, and every public table is owned by
-- resellersos_migration. So we run as postgres, grant that role to postgres (creator has
-- admin on it), and SET ROLE to it. ON_ERROR_STOP guards ONLY the role switch — if that
-- fails we must NOT create policies as the wrong role. Then it is turned OFF so one bad
-- policy (e.g. a helper function that does not exist on Cloud SQL) does not abort the rest.
\set ON_ERROR_STOP on
GRANT resellersos_migration TO postgres;
SET ROLE resellersos_migration;
\echo 'role is now:' 
SELECT current_user;
\set ON_ERROR_STOP off
