-- Storage buckets + policies from production.
-- `supabase db dump --schema public` omits these; without them file upload/download
-- silently fails on a rebuilt DB while every public-schema check looks perfect.
--
-- INSERT policies carry ONLY a WITH CHECK expression -- emitting USING there is a
-- syntax error, which is how the first version of this generator failed.
