-- R-137 (3 Oct 2026): reuse an existing customer only when it is the same business.
--
-- accept_quote and record_payment reused any customer with the lead's contact email. One inbox
-- used for several businesses — the owner's own address on test deals, an accountant who
-- handles three clients, a family that owns two firms — merged them all into one customer.
-- On live, every test quote on pardeep.webmaster@gmail.com landed on "Sri Ganga Technologies":
-- 64 quotes, 11 payments (Rs 3,90,522) and 5 subscriptions, counted in Received and MRR
-- (cleaned up under R-136).
--
-- The rule now (match_existing_customer):
--   1. same GSTIN (format-valid) in this tenant -> that customer. A GSTIN is a legal identity.
--   2. else same email AND the names agree -> that customer. Names agree when, after dropping
--      case, punctuation and legal suffixes (Pvt, Private, Ltd, Limited, LLP, Co, Company, The,
--      India, Inc, OPC), they are equal, or — when the shorter has two or more words — it is
--      the start of the longer: "Excel Tech" ~ "Excel Technologies Pvt Ltd" agree;
--      "Sri" vs "Sri Ganga Technologies" and "Demo Company" vs "Sri Ganga Technologies" differ.
--   3. otherwise no match: a new customer is created.
-- The old comment's warning still holds: when unsure, a duplicate is the lesser error, so a
-- renamed business with the same email may now get a second row — visible and mergeable,
-- unlike a wrong merge.

         Aging and the Balance Sheet both count the whole `net_payable`. A Rs 1,00,000
         invoice with Rs 40,000 received showed Rs 1,00,000 outstanding while the same
         Rs 40,000 was also counted as cash: wrong on both sides of the books at once.
         (Only `sync_project_invoice_paid`, on the project side, ever filled the column,
         which is why it looks populated to anybody who checks a project invoice.)

         paid_amount is written on EVERY payment now. `greatest(0, ...)` because
         v_post_invoice_received is net of advances already adjusted onto the invoice and
         can legitimately go negative; a negative paid_amount would flatter the aging
         rather than merely be wrong.

         status and paid_date still move only on full settlement. invoice_status has no
         'partial' value, and adding one reaches every screen that switches on status —
         that is a change to ask for, not to take. Aging reads net_payable - paid_amount,
         which needs no new status.

         paid_date uses ist_today(): current_date is the UTC day on this server (R-015
         part 1), so an invoice settled at 01:00 IST was stamped yesterday. It is still
         the SETTLEMENT day and not the payment's own received date — record_payment has
         no received-date parameter to read, so the dialog patches that in afterwards. */
