-- Undoing a sale raised from a bank line: an ISSUED tax invoice is reversed with a
-- credit note, not voided (27 Sep 2026).
--
-- unreconcile_bank_receipt(p_undo_sale => true) used to set the invoice to 'void'. That
-- is right for a draft nobody has seen, and wrong for an invoice that was issued: its
-- number is in the series, it may already be in a filed GSTR-1, and the customer has it.
-- GST reverses such a document with a credit note (s.34), which is what issue_credit_note
-- does — the invoice stays, fully credited, with nothing due; the receipt is still removed
-- and the quote reset exactly as before.
--
--   draft            → void (unchanged)
--   pending/paid/overdue → full credit note (reason 'cancellation'), status back to
--                      'pending' with net_payable 0 and no paid date; the note's id is
--                      returned as credit_note_id.
--
-- The existing refusal when the invoice already has a credit/debit note or TDS entry is
-- kept: those cases need a person, not a button.
