-- Regression test for create_project_direct_invoice (0160).
--
-- Proves a direct PROJECT invoice composes create → accept → raise atomically and is
-- GST-correct: the project ends 'active' and one pending tax invoice is raised for the
-- full amount.
--
-- ─── REWRITTEN 22 Aug 2026 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- It borrowed a live customer (`53db44e6…`, since deleted, so the file no longer ran) AND
-- impersonated a real ANUTECH user:
--
--     perform set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', '3caa0f07-44d1-42ee-91b3-2123e04853b1', true);
--
-- which is Pardeep. `create_project_direct_invoice` is not service-role aware — it needs
-- `current_tenant_id()` to resolve — and borrowing a real person's id was the shortest way
-- to get one. The consequence is that the whole test ran inside the live tenant, creating a
-- project and a GST invoice in ANUTECH's books, undone only by the closing exception. See
-- AGENTS.md L11.
--
-- It also asserted nothing: seven values were formatted into one message with the expected
-- figures in brackets beside them, for a human to compare by eye.
--
-- Now it creates its own auth user and its own tenant, so `current_tenant_id()` resolves to
-- a tenant that exists only inside this transaction.
--
-- ⚠️ THIS TEST FAILS TODAY, AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE TEST. The first run of the rewrite hit:
--
--     ERROR 42702: column reference "project_id" is ambiguous
--     QUERY: select id from public.project_milestones where project_id = v_pid order by seq limit 1
--     CONTEXT: PL/pgSQL function create_project_direct_invoice(...)
--
--    The function is `RETURNS TABLE(invoice_id text, project_id uuid)`, so `project_id` is a
--    PL/pgSQL variable inside the body and that line cannot be planned. **Every call has
--    always failed**, which is why `project_sales` and `project_milestones` both have 0 rows
--    while `create-project-quote-dialog.tsx:46` has been wired to it since 0160.
--
--    Fix written, not applied:
--    supabase/migrations/20260822200000_fix_project_direct_invoice_ambiguous_column.sql
--    Apply that and this file should go green.
