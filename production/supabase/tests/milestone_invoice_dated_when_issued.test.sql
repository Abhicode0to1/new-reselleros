-- A milestone invoice is dated the day it is issued (R-003, 26 Sep 2026).
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES
--   1. Two milestones invoiced in one session, whose payments arrived MONTHS apart and
--      out of order, produce invoice numbers and invoice dates that run the same way.
--      Before this change the second one carried the earlier payment's date, so a
--      higher number could sit under an earlier date — which is what a back-dated
--      invoice looks like under CGST Rule 46, and how GSTR-1 would list it.
--   2. `paid_date` still holds the REAL receipt date. Forcing both columns to today
--      would have fixed the series and broken the ledger, which is the more expensive
--      half: it would say the money arrived when the paperwork did.
--   3. `due_date` never lands before the invoice date.
--
-- The fixture owns its data (L11) and rolls back.
