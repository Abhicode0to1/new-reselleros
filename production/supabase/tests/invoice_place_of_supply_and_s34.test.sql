-- Regression test: an invoice is not issued with an unknown place of supply, and a credit
-- note is refused past its CGST Section 34(2) deadline. Migration 20260930174000 (R-041).
-- Rolled back — safe on production.
--
-- Both halves, because a guard is only half-tested by what it blocks:
--
--   BLOCKED  a domestic customer with no state_code — the tax head cannot be decided
--   BLOCKED  a seller with no state_code — same question, other side
--   BLOCKED  a credit note raised after 30 November of the following financial year
--   ALLOWED  an EXPORT customer with no Indian state (zero-rated; nothing to split)
--   ALLOWED  the ordinary intra-state and inter-state cases, with the right head
--   ALLOWED  a credit note inside the deadline
--
-- The ALLOWED half is what stops the guard being deleted: refusing an export, or refusing
-- every credit note, would block work people do every day (L28, L103).
--
-- Fixture owns its data (L11): its own tenants, customers, quotes. Literal ids.
