-- Regression test for the testing sandbox tenant (supabase/maintenance/create-test-tenant.sql)
--
-- WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY IT COULD NOT WAIT
--   Testers were about to be pointed at a sandbox tenant on the PRODUCTION database,
--   on the strength of "RLS is tenant-scoped everywhere". That sentence is true and it
--   is still not evidence: the live tenant holds 14 customers, 21 invoices and 23
--   payments, the plan has no PITR, and the first person to find a hole in the wall
--   would be a tester who does not know a hole is possible.
--
--   So the wall is measured here instead of asserted in a comment. And it is measured
--   WITHOUT waiting for the tester to sign up — a synthetic sandbox member is created
--   inside a transaction, sat in, and rolled back.
--
-- THE CASES (each FAILS LOUDLY — the file is self-asserting)
--   1. A sandbox owner sees ZERO of the live tenant's money.        ← the headline
--   2. A sandbox owner DOES see the sandbox's own item catalogue.   ← not over-blocked
--   3. A sandbox owner cannot write into the live tenant.           ← with_check
--   4. A live-tenant owner sees ZERO sandbox rows.                  ← the wall is two-way
--   5. The sandbox owner's private vault is empty and their own.    ← auth.uid() scope
--
-- WHY CASE 2 IS NOT FILLER
--   Every count in case 1 is expected to be zero, and zero is what a broken query
--   returns too. If RLS were denying this session everything — wrong role, missing
--   claim, a typo in the tenant id — case 1 would pass for the wrong reason and keep
--   passing after the wall came down. Case 2 is the control: the same session, the
--   same role, reading rows it SHOULD see. Without it this file proves nothing.
--
-- SAFETY: synthetic identity in the existing sandbox tenant, one transaction, ends in
-- ROLLBACK. No live row is read into an assertion or written.

  --------------------------------------- 1. THE HEADLINE: none of ANOTHER tenant's business
  /* Every count here is scoped `tenant_id <> v_sandbox`, and that scoping is the whole
     assertion — not tidiness.

     These were bare `count(*)` until 22 Aug 2026, which was correct only for as long as the
     sandbox stayed empty. The day the tester created their 8th customer the test announced
     "a sandbox tester can read 8 customer(s) of the live business" — counting the tester's
     OWN rows and naming them somebody else's. Nothing had leaked: the tester saw 8, the
     sandbox owned 8, and the live tenant's 26 were not among them.

     A security test that cries wolf is worse than no test, because the next reader learns to
     discount it and then disbelieves it on the day it means something. The `users` line
     below was already scoped, and case 2 already scopes `items` — so this is the file's own
     idiom, applied to the seven lines that were missed.

     `<> v_sandbox` rather than `= v_live` on purpose: there is a third tenant (Excel
     Technologies), and "not mine" catches a leak from any of them, not just the big one. */

     user rows, expected 1" — the synthetic owner this file creates plus the real tester who
     signed up into the sandbox on 21 Aug. Both belong there.

     Pinning the number added nothing: "only my own tenant" is already proved in case 1
     (`users where tenant_id <> v_sandbox` = 0). All this control has to establish is that
     the session is not blocked outright, so that case 1's zeros mean a wall and not a dead
     session. An exact count here just re-breaks the test every time the sandbox gains a
