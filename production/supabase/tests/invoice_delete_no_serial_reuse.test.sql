-- Regression test: deleting an invoice must NOT reuse its GST serial (MONEY-3, migration 0118).
-- Self-asserting; rolled back:  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f invoice_delete_no_serial_reuse.test.sql
--
-- Proves the document-series counter is NOT rolled back on delete, so the next
-- invoice takes a FRESH number (a deleted number is retired, never reissued —
-- CGST Rule 46 forbids two supplies sharing one invoice number).
--
-- ── CHANGED 29 Sep 2026 (R-014), and why this is not "fixing the test to match the
--    code" (AGENTS.md L8) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- This file used to call `delete_subscription_invoice` on a freshly ISSUED invoice.
-- Migration 20260929130000 now refuses exactly that, deliberately: an issued invoice is
-- corrected with a credit note, not deleted. The claim this file exists to make —
-- "removing an invoice does NOT free its number" — is unchanged and still worth pinning,
-- so it is now made through the one route that legitimately removes an issued invoice:
-- the reviewed, transaction-scoped `app.invoice_amend_reason` escape hatch.
--
-- The two facts are complementary rather than in conflict. R-014 says a deleted number
-- never comes back, which is the REASON deleting an issued invoice is refused; this file
-- is the proof of that premise. If it ever goes green with the counter rolled back, R-014's
-- refusal message is a lie and both need revisiting.
