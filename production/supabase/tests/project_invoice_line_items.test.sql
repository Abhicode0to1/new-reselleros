-- Regression test: a project-milestone tax invoice carries its particulars (R-010).
-- Migration 20260930178000. Rolled back — safe on production.
--
--   PRESENT   one line item, named "<project> — <milestone>"
--   EXACT     qty × rate = the invoice's own taxable_value
--   SAC       from project_sales.sac_code, not a literal — a project on another code
--             puts THAT code on its invoice
--   BACKFILL  an invoice raised before this migration gets its line, and its amount
--             is not touched
--   FROZEN    a line already written cannot be replaced
--
-- The EXACT case is the one worth the file. CGST Rule 46 is satisfied by any plausible
-- description, so a test that only checked "is there a line?" would stay green over a
-- line that says ₹5,90,000 on a ₹5,00,000 taxable value — a tax invoice contradicting
-- itself in print, which is worse than the blank it replaced.
--
-- Fixture owns its data (L11). service_role throughout: this asserts what the function
-- WRITES, and its tenant guard is covered by definer_rpc_hardening.test.sql.
