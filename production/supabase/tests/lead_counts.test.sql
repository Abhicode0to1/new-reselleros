-- Regression test: lead_counts() and the S40 list_leads() — every number on the Sales &
-- Pipeline screen from the server (S40, migration 20260929130000).
--
-- Self-asserting: RAISEs on failure, one NOTICE "PASS lead_counts" on success. Runs inside a
-- transaction that ROLLS BACK. LOCAL database only:
--
--   node scripts/test-sql.mjs --local lead_counts
--
-- What it proves:
--   1. The three helpers (normPhone, normCompany, looksLikeJunk) give the TypeScript answer
--      on every case row — src/lib/leads/lead-counts-sql-copy.test.ts runs the TS side of the
--      same rows, so the expectations below ARE the TS output.
--   2. Every count lead_counts() returns, hand-derived from a ten-lead fixture that has one
--      lead per rule (dups by phone and by company, a junk lead and a suspect, won/lost,
--      overdue / due-today / future follow-ups, stalled, closing, AI hand-over, …).
--   3. THE PARITY: for 13 views × 9 folders × 6 filter sets, the count lead_counts() reports
--      equals the number of rows list_leads() pages out — the chip and the list cannot
--      disagree. Same for the folder rows and the View-menu counts.
--   4. The team cut narrows the workspace (unowned kept) and leaves the pool alone.
--   5. The 'wait' order: waiting-for-first-reply first (longest first), then answered
--      (slowest first); a note is not a reply; the wait_key cursor walks it exactly.
--   6. S37 callers (no new keys) get S37's rules and order.
--   7. Unknown views / folders / sorts and a cursor of the wrong kind are refused.
--   8. RLS applies (invoker): a sales rep's counts are over own + unowned leads only.
--   9. Tenant isolation, guarded by B seeing exactly its own; 10. no workspace → zeros.
--
-- ─── WHY THE MIGRATION IS COPIED INTO THIS FILE ─────────────────────────────
-- Same rule as list_rpcs.test.sql: the test must run against a database the migration has
-- not reached and still roll everything back, so the migration is pasted verbatim between
-- the COPY markers. src/lib/leads/lead-counts-sql-copy.test.ts (vitest) fails if the copy
-- and the migration ever differ (L8).

begin;

-- >>> BEGIN COPY of supabase/migrations/20260929130000_lead_counts.sql
-- Leads list, server-side: lead_counts() for every number on the screen, and list_leads()
-- taught the rest of the page's filters (S40, 29 Sep 2026).
--
-- ─── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- S37 (20260928200000_list_rpcs.sql) gave list_leads() keyset pages, but the Sales &
-- Pipeline screen could not use them: every number on it — the View menu's counts, the
-- folder counts, Duplicates / Junk, the "Kiska" owner counts, the team-toggle note, the KPI
-- tiles, the hot-lead card — was computed in the browser over `select *` of EVERY lead. At
-- 20,000 leads that is megabytes on every visit, and paging only the list would have added
-- requests and removed none (the page would still need the full set for its counts).
--
-- So this migration moves the counting to the server and gives list_leads() the remaining
-- filters, so the list can page and every chip can be a server count:
--
--   lead_counts(p_filters)  → one jsonb with every count the page shows (see its header).
--   list_leads(…)           → same signature as S37; new OPTIONAL p_filters keys
--                             (owners, smart_view, folder, sort, dup_of, dup_like) and three
--                             more row fields (domain, human_attention_reason, is_duplicate).
--                             A caller that sends none of the new keys gets S37's rows and
--                             order — lead_counts.test.sql re-checks S37's cases against it.
--   leads_dup_phone_idx / leads_dup_company_idx → the duplicate keys, indexed (see below).
--
-- Measured on the local stack with 20,000 leads in one tenant: lead_counts() ≈ 230 ms, one
-- list page ≈ 40 ms (created order) / ≈ 140 ms (wait order).
--
-- The two functions share their WHERE rules by COPY, not by a shared row function: a
-- per-row plpgsql helper would run 20,000 times per call, and the page asks for counts on
-- every filter change. lead_counts.test.sql pins the copy — for every view and folder, the
-- count lead_counts() reports equals the number of rows list_leads() pages out.
--
-- ─── THE RULES ARE THE PAGE'S RULES ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- Each predicate mirrors one TypeScript rule, named beside it. Where the TS read the
-- browser's clock, SQL reads the IST day: `today` = (now() at time zone 'Asia/Kolkata')::date
-- (AGENTS.md §6). One deliberate difference, fixed on BOTH sides in the same commit: the
-- "Today" view compared created_at's UTC date prefix with the IST date, so a lead that
-- arrived between 00:00 and 05:30 IST was not "today" until tomorrow. Both sides now use
-- created_at's IST date.
--
-- ─── WHO SEES WHAT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- SECURITY INVOKER, `tenant_id = public.current_tenant_id()` on every read, execute to
-- `authenticated` only — the same contract as S37. A count can therefore never include a
-- lead the caller could not select, including under the leads hierarchy policy.

-- ── Pure helpers — the TS heuristics, byte for byte ────────────────────────
-- Immutable, no table access. Granted to authenticated because the invoker functions below
-- call them as the caller.
--
-- The two KEY functions are indexed (leads_dup_*_idx below), so a query reads their values
-- from the index and only ever computes them for a handful of rows. They carry
-- `set search_path = ''` and COST 1000 on purpose: the SET stops Postgres inlining them into
-- bare regexp calls, and the cost tells the planner a call is expensive — at the defaults
-- it priced the phone key at almost nothing and recomputed it over every lead (2.9 s for
-- one page's duplicate flags at 20,000 leads) instead of probing the index.
--
-- lead_looks_like_junk is NOT indexed and runs on every lead in lead_counts(), so it has
-- NO SET clause, deliberately: a SET makes every call pay a GUC save/restore and blocks
-- inlining (measured locally at 20,000 leads: 690 ms per lead_counts() call with it, 530 ms
-- without). It reads only pg_catalog built-ins (always searched first) and no table, so
-- there is nothing a caller's search_path could redirect.

-- ── Duplicate keys, indexed ────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The duplicate rule compares two derived keys across the whole workspace. Deriving them
-- per row is the expensive part of every count (a regex pass over every lead), so they are
-- indexed once, at write time. With these, "which keys are shared" is an index-only scan,
-- "is this row a duplicate?" is one probe, and the 50 rows of a page carry their flag for
-- free. INCLUDE: owner_id because the team cut and the leads hierarchy policy read it; id
-- because that is what the scan returns; and the raw column because Postgres will only
-- plan an index-only scan over an expression index when the expression's input column is
-- in the index too.
--
-- ⚠ If lead_norm_phone / lead_norm_company are ever changed, REINDEX these two: an
-- expression index keeps the keys the OLD function computed.

--                        with no owner (list-selectors.ts#searchLeads step 3b, UNASSIGNED).
--   smart_view  text   — the View menu (list-selectors.ts#searchLeads step 4). When PRESENT
--                        it also decides the junk cut exactly as the page does: 'junk' shows
--                        confirmed junk + heuristic suspects, every other view hides junk
--                        (the `junk` key is then ignored). Absent = S37 behaviour.

-- ── lead_counts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Every number the Sales & Pipeline screen shows, in one round trip.
--
-- p_filters — the SAME keys list_leads() reads (owner_ids / owner_id = the team toggle;
-- search, stages, priorities, owners, smart_view = the list's filters; folder = the folder
-- in force). Each section is counted over the base the page used for it:
--
--   pool       — every lead the caller can see, no filter at all (the page's `leads`):
--                total, unassigned, high_priority, by_owner { owner_id: n }.
--                → team-toggle note, "Kiska" counts, KPI "High Priority" / "Total Inquiries".
--   workspace  — the team cut only (`workspaceLeads`): junk, everything (non-junk), suspects
--                (non-junk the heuristic flags). → "All leads", Junk entry.
--   views      — open leads in the workspace (`leadsForTab`): all, mine, waiting, today,
--                overdue, hot, new, stalled, closing, duplicates. → the View menu.
--   folders    — the searched set (`searched`: every filter + the smart view):
--                inbox, talks, quoted, proving, won, lost, hot, followup. → folder rows.
--   list       — the list itself (`filtered` = searched + folder cut): matching,
--                hot (quote/trial rows), hot_top (the highest-value one of those, newest
--                first on a tie — the page's stable sort over a newest-first list).
--   kpi        — non-junk workspace (`pipelineTotals`): open_count, open_value,
--                open_value_project, won, lost.
--   today      — the IST date every date rule used, so the client can show it.
