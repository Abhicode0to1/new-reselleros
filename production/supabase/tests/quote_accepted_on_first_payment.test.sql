-- Regression test for migration 20260821210000_accept_quote_on_first_payment.sql
--
-- WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY IT NEEDED PROVING IN SQL
--   `record_payment` already did the irreversible half of "accepted" on the FIRST payment
--   of any size: it inserts the customer row (lead -> customer) and creates the
--   subscription. Only the status label lagged, gated on v_is_fully_paid. So a quote
--   holding Rs 50,000 of Rs 50,027 sat at 'sent', the lifecycle bar said "Waiting for the
--   customer to accept", and the page offered a "Mark accepted" button whose stated job
--   -- "convert the lead into a customer" -- had already been done. Found by Pardeep on
--   Q-ADPL-2026-27-0026 (delhom), 21 Aug 2026.
--
--   This is a SECURITY DEFINER money RPC. Nothing in the TypeScript suite executes it, so
--   a green `npm run test` says nothing at all about this change. This file is the test.
--
-- THE CASES (each FAILS LOUDLY -- the file is self-asserting)
--   1. A PARTIAL payment promotes a 'sent' quote to 'accepted'.        <- the change
--   2. ...and payment_status is still 'partial'.                       <- money untouched
--   3. ...and the customer row was created by the same call.           <- why 1 is honest
--   4. Deleting that payment demotes the quote back to 'sent'.         <- symmetric
--   5. A FULL payment still lands 'accepted' + 'received'.             <- no regression
--   6. A 'rejected' quote is NOT promoted by a payment.                <- forward only
--
-- ON CASE 6: the promotion has always been written as `status in ('draft','sent','viewed')`
--   and this change did not touch that list. It is asserted anyway, because the whole
--   point of removing a condition from a CASE arm is that it is easy to remove one too
--   many, and "rejected quote silently becomes accepted when money arrives" is the kind of
--   bug that would be found by an accountant, not by us.
--
-- SAFETY: synthetic tenant, synthetic quote, one transaction, ends in ROLLBACK. No real
-- row is read into an assertion or written. The receipt-voucher number that record_payment
-- allocates is rolled back with everything else, so no live document series is consumed.

begin;

-- service_role context: record_payment takes the tenant carve-out only because it has no
-- auth.uid() here. This is the same reasoning as the RLS tests -- auth.role() reads
-- request.jwt.claims, and set_config supplies it.
