-- Regression test for the recurring option on create_direct_invoice (0159).
--
-- Proves the one-time / recurring choice drives whether paying the invoice creates a
-- subscription:
--   RECURRING (p_recurring = true)  → quotes.is_one_off = false → paying it creates a
--                                     yearly subscription.
--   ONE-TIME  (p_recurring = false) → quotes.is_one_off = true  → paying it creates NONE.
--
-- ─── REWRITTEN 22 Aug 2026 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- It borrowed a live customer (`53db44e6…`, since deleted) and did
-- `update customers set country='India'` on that real row, so it both broke and wrote to
-- ANUTECH's books; and it asserted nothing, ending `raise exception 'TESTRESULT >> %'` with
-- the expected values in a header comment. See AGENTS.md L11.
--
-- ⚠️ THE ONE-TIME HALF IS EXPECTED TO FAIL RIGHT NOW, and that is the point.
--    `record_payment` does not contain the string `is_one_off` at all — migration 0157's
--    guard is gone — so paying a one-time direct invoice creates a subscription anyway. This
--    file reaches that conclusion independently of
--    `record_payment_one_off_guard.test.sql`, which found it the same evening from the other
--    direction. Two tests, one missing guard, neither of them run for months.
--
--    Restoring the guard is a migration and a money-code decision. Making this test agree
--    with the code instead would retire the guard in silence — see AGENTS.md L8.
