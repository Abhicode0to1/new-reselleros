# Cross-team requests — from Pardeep (Accounting & Finance)

When Accounting & Finance work needs a change in code another person owns, we do **not**
edit their code. We write the request here, and Pardeep passes it to the owner.

| Area | Owner | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| Billing & Subscriptions (Customers, Parent Accounts, Quotes, Subscriptions, Renewals, Invoices, Payments Received, Project Sales) | Abhishek | `abhishek-pre-merge` |
| Customer UI, customer panel, checkout process | Pawan | `pawan-api-system` |
| Accounting & Finance (`/accounting/*`, `/compliance/*`, Reports Hub) | Pardeep | `pardeep-sir` |

Status values: **Open** → **Sent** (Pardeep told the owner) → **Done** (merged into our branch).

## Open

### R-001 · `useCreateCustomer` can put a customer in the wrong company, or report a fake one
- **For:** Abhishek
- **Status:** Open
- **Raised:** 2026-09-25
- **Why accounting needs it:** Banking → Reconcile → "Kisi sale / customer ka paisa?" now opens your
  `AddCustomerForm` for "＋ Naya customer" (used as-is, not changed). The customer it returns is then
  invoiced against a real bank receipt, so the two problems below can reach the books.
- **What to change** — `production/src/lib/queries/customers.ts`, `useCreateCustomer`:
  1. **Line ~69 — hardcoded tenant.** `let tenantId = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"` is used
     whenever the user/tenant lookup returns nothing. That is the local demo tenant; in production a
     failed lookup would insert the customer into the wrong company (AGENTS.md: never hardcode a
     tenant). It should throw instead ("Not signed in / not linked to a company").
  2. **Lines ~134–162 — fake customer on insert failure.** When the insert errors, it builds a
     `CUST-<timestamp>` customer, puts it in the list cache and returns it as success
     ("Dev mode customer insert warning"). The screen then shows a customer that does not exist, and
     anything done with its id (invoice, reconcile) fails later with a confusing error (AGENTS.md: never
     turn a failure into a plausible value). It should `throw error` so the form shows the real reason.
- **Done when:** a failed insert shows an error and adds nothing to the list; no code path inserts
  with tenant `11111111-…`.

### R-002 · "New project sale" should pick a real customer, not a typed name
- **For:** Abhishek
- **Status:** Open
- **Raised:** 2026-09-25
- **Why accounting needs it:** Banking → Reconcile → "Project payment" sends a bank receipt to
  `/projects?amount=…&reconcile=…` to be booked as a project sale. Today the project is saved with
  `customerId: null` and only a typed name, so:
  - the sale never appears in that customer's **Ledger (Khata)** or **Customer Aging**;
  - a typo ("Excel Tech" vs "Excel Technologies") silently becomes a different party;
  - IGST vs CGST+SGST comes from a manual checkbox, not the customer's state — the same
    "place of supply assumed" problem the GST health card on Accounting Overview flags.
- **What to change** — `production/src/components/features/projects/create-project-dialog.tsx`:
  1. Replace the free-text Customer `Input` (line ~117) with the existing
     `components/features/customers/customer-combobox.tsx`, plus a "＋ New customer" that opens the
     existing `AddCustomerForm` (same pattern as the quote builder and the reconcile dialog).
  2. Send the chosen `customerId` (line ~91) instead of `null`, with `customerName` from the record.
  3. Default the inter-state checkbox from the customer's `state_code` vs the seller's state
     (still editable).
- **Done when:** a project sale created from the dialog has `customer_id` set and shows under that
  customer's Ledger; inter-state is pre-set from the customer.
